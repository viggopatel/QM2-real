        "\n",
        "Exxon Mobil is the 4th largest oil company in the world. In 1978, an Exxon scientist named James Black wrote an [internal briefing](https://insideclimatenews.org/documents/james-black-1977-presentation/) called \"The Greenhouse Effect\" in which he warned: “Present thinking holds that man has a time window of five to ten years before the need for hard decisions regarding changes in energy strategies might become critical.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Rather than acting on this information, Exxon spent the next [forty years aggressively funding climate denial](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2021/09/oil-companies-discourage-climate-action-study-says/). Recently, [a U.S. court ruled](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/24/exxon-trial-climate-crimes-fossil-fuels-global-heating) that ExxonMobil must face trial over accusations that it lied about the climate crisis and covered up the fossil fuel industry’s role in worsening environmental devastation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Earnings Calls\n",
        "Every three months, Exxon conducts an [\"earnings call\"](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnings-call.asp); a conference call between the management of a public company, analysts, investors, and the media to discuss the company’s financial results during a given reporting period, such as a quarter or a fiscal year.\n",

        "You can [register](https://globalmeet.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1488251&tp_key=440e363aaf) to attend their next one if you want! No worries if you miss it, they provide [transcripts](https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/Investors/Investor-relations/Investor-materials-archive#Quarterlyearningsmaterials) on their website.\n",
        "\n",
        "These transcripts provide an intimate window into the company's dealings. We can see how much pressure investors are putting on the company to tackle climate change, and how the company responds.\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll be working with transcripts spanning nealry 20 years and over 10 million words; that's like reading the Harry Potter series 10 times. Then, we'll look at a sample of 100,000 tweets that use the #ExxonKnew hashtag, and analyze public pressure on the company.\n",

Capital and exploration expenditures were $6.2 billion in the second \\nquarter and $12.5 billion for the first half of 2023, in line with the company's full-year guidance of $23 billion to $25 \\nbillion.\\n\\n“The work we've been doing to improve our underlying profitability is reflected in our second-quarter results, which \\ndoubled from what we earned in a comparable industry commodity price environment4 just five years ago,” said \\nDarren Woods, chairman and chief executive officer.\\n\\n“Earnings totaled more than $19 billion during the first half of the year, and we are on track to structurally reduce \\ncosts by $9 billion at year end compared to 2019. Production is up 20% year-over-year in Guyana and the Permian, \\nand we are playing a leading role in the industry's energy transition with an agreement to acquire Denbury and with \\nthree world-scale CO2 offtake agreements.

Excluding the identified item \\n\\nassociated with additional European taxes on the energy sector, earnings were $7.9 billion compared with $11.6 \\nbillion in the prior quarter. \\n\\n• Lower natural gas realizations and industry refining margins adversely impacted earnings. Results benefited \\nfrom the absence of prior quarter unfavorable derivative mark-to-market impacts.\\n\\n• The company remains on track to deliver $9 billion of structural cost savings by the end of 2023 relative to 2019, \\nhaving achieved cumulative structural cost savings of $8.3 billion to date.\\n\\n• Cash flow from operations totaled $9.4 billion and free cash flow was $5.0 billion, which includes a net working \\ncapital impact of $3.6 billion primarily driven by higher seasonal cash tax payments. Cash flow from operations \\nexcluding working capital was $13.0 billion. The company's debt-to-capital ratio remained at 17% and net-debt-\\nto-capital ratio was 5%, reflecting a period-end cash balance of $29.6 billion.\\n\\n• The three new central organizations formed this past quarter, Global Business Solutions, ExxonMobil Supply \\nChain, and Global Trading, are off to a good start, further leveraging the company's scale and integrated \\nbusiness model to lower cost and improve performance.\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\nShareholder Distributions\\n• Second-quarter shareholder distributions of $8.0 billion included $4.3 billion of share repurchases and $3.7 \\n\\nbillion of dividends.\\n\\n• The Corporation declared a third-quarter dividend of $0.91 per share, payable on Sept. 11, 2023, to shareholders \\nof record of Common Stock at the close of business on Aug. 16, 2023.\\n\\nADVANCING CLIMATE SOLUTIONS\\n\\nCarbon Capture and Storage1\\n\\n• Already a global leader in carbon capture and storage (CCS), ExxonMobil expanded its position further by \\nentering into a definitive agreement to acquire Denbury Inc. The planned acquisition provides ExxonMobil with \\none of the largest owned and operated carbon dioxide (CO2) pipeline networks in the United States at 1,300 \\nmiles, most of which is located along the U.S. Gulf Coast, one of the largest U.S. markets for CO2 emissions. \\nThe planned acquisition includes 10 strategically located onshore sequestration sites as well as Denbury's 20-\\nplus years of expertise in transporting and storing CO2. An established, cost-efficient transportation and storage \\nsystem accelerates CCS deployment for ExxonMobil and third-party customers and underpins multiple low-\\ncarbon value chains including CCS, hydrogen, ammonia, biofuels, and direct air capture.\\n\\n• ExxonMobil and Nucor Corporation, one of North America’s largest steel producers, have entered into a long-\\nterm commercial agreement in which ExxonMobil, subject to government permitting, will capture, transport, and \\nstore up to 800,000 metric tons of CO2 per year from Nucor’s steel manufacturing site in Convent, Louisiana. \\nThe project, expected to start up in 2026, will tie into the same CO2 infrastructure that will be used by the \\ncompany’s project with CF Industries.\\n\\nThe agreement with Nucor is the third CCS agreement announced in the past twelve months and brings the total \\ncontracted CO2 to transport and store for third-party customers to 5 million metric tons per year. That is \\nequivalent to replacing approximately 2 million gasoline-powered cars with electric vehicles2, which is roughly \\nequal to the number of electric vehicles on U.S. roads today.\\n\\n1 The emission reduction outcome of these projects is subject to the timing and regulatory approval of necessary permits, acquisition of rights of way, changes in \\nregulatory policy, supply chain disruptions, and other market conditions.\\n\\n2 ExxonMobil analysis based on assumptions for U.S. in 2022, including average distance traveled, fuel efficiency, average power grid carbon intensity, electric \\nvehicle charging efficiency and other factors. Gas-powered cars include light-duty vehicles (cars, light trucks and SUVs).\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\n\\n.\\n\\nEARNINGS AND VOLUME SUMMARY BY SEGMENT\\n\\nUpstream\\n2Q23 1Q23 2Q22 Dollars in millions (unless otherwise noted) YTD \\n\\n2023\\nYTD \\n2022\\n\\nEarnings/(Loss) (U.S. GAAP)\\n 920  1,632  3,749 United States  2,552  6,125 \\n 3,657  4,825  7,622 Non-U.S.  8,482  9,734 \\n 4,577  6,457  11,371 Worldwide  11,034  15,859 \\n\\nEarnings/(Loss) Excluding Identified Items (non-GAAP)\\n 920  1,632  3,450 United States  2,552  5,826 \\n 3,669  4,983  7,622 Non-U.S.  8,652  12,989 \\n 4,589  6,615  11,072 Worldwide  11,204  18,815 \\n\\n 3,608  3,831  3,732 Production (koebd)  3,719  3,704 \\n\\n• Upstream second-quarter earnings were $4.6 billion, a decrease of $1.9 billion from the first quarter. The main \\nfactors were lower natural gas prices, which declined 40%, and seasonally higher scheduled maintenance. \\nIdentified items unfavorably impacted earnings by $12 million this quarter, down from $158 million in the \\nprevious quarter.

Excluding identified items, earnings \\ndeclined $6.5 billion, driven by lower crude and natural gas realizations. Production in Guyana and the Permian \\ngrew by a combined 20% compared to the prior-year quarter. The increase was offset by impacts from \\ndivestments, the Sakhalin-1 expropriation, and government-mandated curtailments.\\n\\n• Year-to-date earnings were $11.0 billion, a decrease of $4.8 billion versus the first half of 2022. The prior-year \\nperiod was negatively impacted by an identified item associated with the Sakhalin-1 expropriation. Excluding \\nidentified items, earnings declined $7.6 billion year-over-year. Higher production from advantaged projects in \\nGuyana and the Permian provided a partial offset to lower crude and natural gas realizations. Year-to-date \\nproduction was 3.7 million oil-equivalent barrels per day. Excluding divestments, entitlements, government \\nmandates, and the Sakhalin-1 expropriation, net production grew by more than 160,000 oil-equivalent barrels \\nper day driven by Guyana and the Permian.   \\n\\n4\\n\\n\\n\\nEnergy Products\\n2Q23 1Q23 2Q22 Dollars in millions (unless otherwise noted) YTD \\n\\n2023\\nYTD \\n2022\\n\\nEarnings/(Loss) (U.S. GAAP)\\n 1,528  1,910  2,655 United States  3,438  3,144 \\n 782  2,273  2,617 Non-U.S.  3,055  1,933 \\n 2,310  4,183  5,273 Worldwide  6,493  5,077 \\n\\nEarnings/(Loss) Excluding Identified Items (non-GAAP)\\n 1,528  1,910  2,655 United States  3,438  3,144 \\n 764  2,303  2,617 Non-U.S.  3,067  1,933 \\n 2,292  4,213  5,273 Worldwide  6,505  5,077 \\n\\n 5,658  5,277  5,310 Energy Products Sales (kbd)  5,469  5,211 \\n\\n• Energy Products second-quarter earnings totaled $2.3 billion, down $1.9 billion from the first quarter.

These include global or regional \\n\\n9\\n\\n\\n\\nchanges in the supply and demand for oil, natural gas, petrochemicals, and feedstocks and other market factors, economic \\nconditions and seasonal fluctuations that impact prices and differentials for our products; government policies supporting lower \\ncarbon investment opportunities such as the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act or policies limiting the attractiveness of future \\ninvestment such as the additional European taxes on the energy sector; variable impacts of trading activities on our margins and \\nresults each quarter; actions of competitors and commercial counterparties; the outcome of commercial negotiations, including \\nfinal agreed terms and conditions; the ability to access debt markets; the ultimate impacts of COVID-19 or other public health \\ncrises, including the effects of government responses on people and economies; reservoir performance, including variability and \\ntiming factors applicable to unconventional resources; the level and outcome of exploration projects and decisions to invest in \\nfuture reserves; timely completion of development and other construction projects; final management approval of future projects \\nand any changes in the scope, terms, or costs of such projects as approved; government policies and support and market \\ndemand for low carbon technologies; war, civil unrest, attacks against the company or industry and other political or security \\ndisturbances; expropriations, seizure, or capacity, insurance or shipping limitations by foreign governments or laws; \\nopportunities for potential acquisitions, investments or divestments and satisfaction of applicable conditions to closing, including \\ntimely regulatory approvals; the capture of efficiencies within and between business lines and the ability to maintain near-term \\ncost reductions as ongoing efficiencies; unforeseen technical or operating difficulties and unplanned maintenance; the \\ndevelopment and competitiveness of alternative energy and emission reduction technologies; the results of research programs \\nand the ability to bring new technologies to commercial scale on a cost-competitive basis; and other factors discussed under \\nItem 1A. Risk Factors of ExxonMobil’s 2022 Form 10-K.  \\n\\nForward-looking and other statements regarding our environmental, social and other sustainability efforts and aspirations are \\nnot an indication that these statements are necessarily material to investors or requiring disclosure in our filing with the SEC. In \\naddition, historical, current, and forward-looking environmental, social and sustainability-related statements may be based on \\nstandards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and \\nassumptions that are subject to change in the future, including future rule-making.\\n\\nFrequently Used Terms and Non-GAAP Measures\\n\\nThis press release includes cash flow from operations and asset sales (non-GAAP). Because of the regular nature of our asset \\nmanagement and divestment program, the company believes it is useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with the \\nsales of subsidiaries, property, plant and equipment, and sales and returns of investments together with cash provided by \\noperating activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the business and financing activities. A reconciliation to net \\ncash provided by operating activities for the 2022 and 2023 periods is shown on page 7.\\n\\nThis press release also includes cash flow from operations excluding working capital (non-GAAP), and cash flow from \\noperations and asset sales excluding working capital (non-GAAP). The company believes it is useful for investors to consider \\nthese numbers in comparing the underlying performance of the company's business across periods when there are significant \\nperiod-to-period differences in the amount of changes in working capital. A reconciliation to net cash provided by operating \\nactivities for the 2022 and 2023 periods is shown on page 7. \\n\\nThis press release also includes earnings/(loss) excluding identified items (non-GAAP), which are earnings/(loss) excluding \\nindividually significant non-operational events with, typically, an absolute corporate total earnings impact of at least $250 million \\nin a given quarter. The earnings/(loss) impact of an identified item for an individual segment may be less than $250 million when \\nthe item impacts several periods or several segments. Earnings/(loss) excluding identified items does include non-operational \\nearnings events or impacts that are generally below the $250 million threshold utilized for identified items. When the effect of \\nthese events is significant in aggregate, it is indicated in analysis of period results as part of quarterly earnings press release \\nand teleconference materials. Management uses these figures to improve comparability of the underlying business across \\nmultiple periods by isolating and removing significant non-operational events from business results. The Corporation believes \\nthis view provides investors increased transparency into business results and trends and provides investors with a view of the \\nbusiness as seen through the eyes of management. Earnings excluding identified items is not meant to be viewed in isolation or \\nas a substitute for net income/(loss) attributable to ExxonMobil as prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation to \\nearnings is shown for 2023 and 2022 periods in Attachments II-a and II-b. Corresponding per share amounts are shown on \\npage 1 and in Attachment II-a, including a reconciliation to earnings/(loss) per common share – assuming dilution (U.S. GAAP).\\n\\nThis press release also includes total taxes including sales-based taxes. This is a broader indicator of the total tax burden on the \\nCorporation’s products and earnings, including certain sales and value-added taxes imposed on and concurrent with revenue-\\nproducing transactions with customers and collected on behalf of governmental authorities (“sales-based taxes”). It combines \\n“Income taxes” and “Total other taxes and duties” with sales-based taxes, which are reported net in the income statement. The \\ncompany believes it is useful for the Corporation and its investors to understand the total tax burden imposed on the \\nCorporation’s products and earnings. A reconciliation to total taxes is shown in Attachment I-a.\\n\\nThis press release also references free cash flow (non-GAAP). Free cash flow is the sum of net cash provided by operating \\nactivities and net cash flow used in investing activities. This measure is useful when evaluating cash available for financing \\nactivities, including shareholder distributions, after investment in the business. Free cash flow is not meant to be viewed in \\n\\n10\\n\\n\\n\\nisolation or as a substitute for net cash provided by operating activities. A reconciliation to net cash provided by operating \\nactivities for the 2022 and 2023 periods is shown on page 7. \\n\\nReferences to resources or resource base may include quantities of oil and natural gas classified as proved reserves, as well as \\nquantities that are not yet classified as proved reserves, but that are expected to be ultimately recoverable. The term “resource \\nbase” or similar terms are not intended to correspond to SEC definitions such as “probable” or “possible” reserves. A \\nreconciliation of production excluding divestments, entitlements, and government mandates to actual production is contained in \\nthe Supplement to this release included as Exhibit 99.2 to the Form 8-K filed the same day as this news release.\\n\\nThe term “project” as used in this news release can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the \\nsame meaning as in any government payment transparency reports. Projects or plans may not reflect investment decisions \\nmade by the company. Individual opportunities may advance based on a number of factors, including availability of supportive \\npolicy, technology for cost-effective abatement, and alignment with our partners and other stakeholders. The company may refer \\nto these opportunities as projects in external disclosures at various stages throughout their progression.\\n\\nGovernment mandates are changes to ExxonMobil’s sustainable production levels as a result of production limits or sanctions \\nimposed by governments.\\n\\nThis press release also references structural cost savings, for more details see page 8.\\n\\nReference to Earnings\\n\\nReferences to corporate earnings mean net income attributable to ExxonMobil (U.S. GAAP) from the consolidated income \\nstatement. Unless otherwise indicated, references to earnings, Upstream, Energy Products, Chemical Products, Specialty \\nProducts and Corporate and Financing segment earnings, and earnings per share are ExxonMobil’s share after excluding \\namounts attributable to noncontrolling interests. \\n\\nExxon Mobil Corporation has numerous affiliates, many with names that include ExxonMobil, Exxon, Mobil, Esso, and XTO. For \\nconvenience and simplicity, those terms and terms such as Corporation, company, our, we, and its are sometimes used as \\nabbreviated references to specific affiliates or affiliate groups. Similarly, ExxonMobil has business relationships with thousands \\nof customers, suppliers, governments, and others. For convenience and simplicity, words such as venture, joint venture, \\npartnership, co-venturer, and partner are used to indicate business and other relationships involving common activities and \\ninterests, and those words may not indicate precise legal relationships. ExxonMobil's ambitions, plans and goals do not \\nguarantee any action or future performance by its affiliates or Exxon Mobil Corporation's responsibility for those affiliates' actions \\nand future performance, each affiliate of which manages its own affairs.  \\n\\nThroughout this press release, both Exhibit 99.1 as well as Exhibit 99.2, due to rounding, numbers presented may not add up \\nprecisely to the totals indicated.\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\n\\n.\\n\\nATTACHMENT I-a\\n\\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME\\n(Preliminary)\\n\\nDollars in millions (unless otherwise noted)\\nThree

Capital and exploration expenditures were $6.2 billion in the second \\nquarter and $12.5 billion for the first half of 2023, in line with the company's full-year guidance of $23 billion to $25 \\nbillion.\\n\\n\\u201cThe work we've been doing to improve our underlying profitability is reflected in our second-quarter results, which \\ndoubled from what we earned in a comparable industry commodity price environment4 just five years ago,\\u201d said \\nDarren Woods, chairman and chief executive officer.\\n\\n\\u201cEarnings totaled more than $19 billion during the first half of the year, and we are on track to structurally reduce \\ncosts by $9 billion at year end compared to 2019. Production is up 20% year-over-year in Guyana and the Permian, \\nand we are playing a leading role in the industry's energy transition with an agreement to acquire Denbury and with \\nthree world-scale CO2 offtake agreements. This reflects the significant opportunity to profitably grow our Low Carbon \\nSolutions business by creating a compelling customer decarbonization proposition with the potential to reduce Gulf \\nCoast industrial emissions by 100 million metric tons per year5.\\u201d\\n\\n1 Highest second-quarter global refinery throughput in the last 15 years (2009-2023) based on current refinery circuit.\\n2 Based on contracts to move 5 MTA starting in 2025 subject to additional investment by ExxonMobil and permitting for carbon capture and storage projects.\\n3 Assuming dilution.\\n4 Based on ExxonMobil's assessment of historical industry commodity prices and margins referencing Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), S&P Global Platts, IHS \\n\\nMarkit as well as company estimates and analysis, the second-quarter 2023 industry commodity price environment is comparable to the second-quarter of \\n2018.

Excluding the identified item \\n\\nassociated with additional European taxes on the energy sector, earnings were $7.9 billion compared with $11.6 \\nbillion in the prior quarter. \\n\\n\\u2022 Lower natural gas realizations and industry refining margins adversely impacted earnings. Results benefited \\nfrom the absence of prior quarter unfavorable derivative mark-to-market impacts.\\n\\n\\u2022 The company remains on track to deliver $9 billion of structural cost savings by the end of 2023 relative to 2019, \\nhaving achieved cumulative structural cost savings of $8.3 billion to date.\\n\\n\\u2022 Cash flow from operations totaled $9.4 billion and free cash flow was $5.0 billion, which includes a net working \\ncapital impact of $3.6 billion primarily driven by higher seasonal cash tax payments. Cash flow from operations \\nexcluding working capital was $13.0 billion. The company's debt-to-capital ratio remained at 17% and net-debt-\\nto-capital ratio was 5%, reflecting a period-end cash balance of $29.6 billion.\\n\\n\\u2022 The three new central organizations formed this past quarter, Global Business Solutions, ExxonMobil Supply \\nChain, and Global Trading, are off to a good start, further leveraging the company's scale and integrated \\nbusiness model to lower cost and improve performance.\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\nShareholder Distributions\\n\\u2022 Second-quarter shareholder distributions of $8.0 billion included $4.3 billion of share repurchases and $3.7 \\n\\nbillion of dividends.\\n\\n\\u2022 The Corporation declared a third-quarter dividend of $0.91 per share, payable on Sept. 11, 2023, to shareholders \\nof record of Common Stock at the close of business on Aug. 16, 2023.\\n\\nADVANCING CLIMATE SOLUTIONS\\n\\nCarbon Capture and Storage1\\n\\n\\u2022 Already a global leader in carbon capture and storage (CCS), ExxonMobil expanded its position further by \\nentering into a definitive agreement to acquire Denbury Inc. The planned acquisition provides ExxonMobil with \\none of the largest owned and operated carbon dioxide (CO2) pipeline networks in the United States at 1,300 \\nmiles, most of which is located along the U.S. Gulf Coast, one of the largest U.S. markets for CO2 emissions. \\nThe planned acquisition includes 10 strategically located onshore sequestration sites as well as Denbury's 20-\\nplus years of expertise in transporting and storing CO2. An established, cost-efficient transportation and storage \\nsystem accelerates CCS deployment for ExxonMobil and third-party customers and underpins multiple low-\\ncarbon value chains including CCS, hydrogen, ammonia, biofuels, and direct air capture.\\n\\n\\u2022 ExxonMobil and Nucor Corporation, one of North America\\u2019s largest steel producers, have entered into a long-\\nterm commercial agreement in which ExxonMobil, subject to government permitting, will capture, transport, and \\nstore up to 800,000 metric tons of CO2 per year from Nucor\\u2019s steel manufacturing site in Convent, Louisiana. \\nThe project, expected to start up in 2026, will tie into the same CO2 infrastructure that will be used by the \\ncompany\\u2019s project with CF Industries.\\n\\nThe agreement with Nucor is the third CCS agreement announced in the past twelve months and brings the total \\ncontracted CO2 to transport and store for third-party customers to 5 million metric tons per year. That is \\nequivalent to replacing approximately 2 million gasoline-powered cars with electric vehicles2, which is roughly \\nequal to the number of electric vehicles on U.S. roads today.\\n\\n1 The emission reduction outcome of these projects is subject to the timing and regulatory approval of necessary permits, acquisition of rights of way, changes in \\nregulatory policy, supply chain disruptions, and other market conditions.\\n\\n2 ExxonMobil analysis based on assumptions for U.S. in 2022, including average distance traveled, fuel efficiency, average power grid carbon intensity, electric \\nvehicle charging efficiency and other factors. Gas-powered cars include light-duty vehicles (cars, light trucks and SUVs).\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\n\\n.\\n\\nEARNINGS AND VOLUME SUMMARY BY SEGMENT\\n\\nUpstream\\n2Q23 1Q23 2Q22 Dollars in millions (unless otherwise noted) YTD \\n\\n2023\\nYTD \\n2022\\n\\nEarnings/(Loss) (U.S. GAAP)\\n 920  1,632  3,749 United States  2,552  6,125 \\n 3,657  4,825  7,622 Non-U.S.  8,482  9,734 \\n 4,577  6,457  11,371 Worldwide  11,034  15,859 \\n\\nEarnings/(Loss) Excluding Identified Items (non-GAAP)\\n 920  1,632  3,450 United States  2,552  5,826 \\n 3,669  4,983  7,622 Non-U.S.  8,652  12,989 \\n 4,589  6,615  11,072 Worldwide  11,204  18,815 \\n\\n 3,608  3,831  3,732 Production (koebd)  3,719  3,704 \\n\\n\\u2022 Upstream second-quarter earnings were $4.6 billion, a decrease of $1.9 billion from the first quarter. The main \\nfactors were lower natural gas prices, which declined 40%, and seasonally higher scheduled maintenance. \\nIdentified items unfavorably impacted earnings by $12 million this quarter, down from $158 million in the \\nprevious quarter. Earnings excluding identified items decreased from $6.6 billion in the first quarter to $4.6 \\nbillion in the second quarter.\\n\\n\\u2022 Compared to the same quarter last year, earnings decreased $6.8 billion. Excluding identified items, earnings \\ndeclined $6.5 billion, driven by lower crude and natural gas realizations. Production in Guyana and the Permian \\ngrew by a combined 20% compared to the prior-year quarter. The increase was offset by impacts from \\ndivestments, the Sakhalin-1 expropriation, and government-mandated curtailments.\\n\\n\\u2022 Year-to-date earnings were $11.0 billion, a decrease of $4.8 billion versus the first half of 2022. The prior-year \\nperiod was negatively impacted by an identified item associated with the Sakhalin-1 expropriation. Excluding \\nidentified items, earnings declined $7.6 billion year-over-year. Higher production from advantaged projects in \\nGuyana and the Permian provided a partial offset to lower crude and natural gas realizations. Year-to-date \\nproduction was 3.7 million oil-equivalent barrels per day.

Estimates of \\ncumulative annual structural savings may be revised depending on whether cost reductions realized in prior periods are \\ndetermined to be sustainable compared to 2019 levels. For example, in 2Q23 we recognized an additional $0.5 billion of prior \\nperiod reductions that we now view as structurally sustainable.

Because of the regular nature of our asset \\nmanagement and divestment program, the company believes it is useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with the \\nsales of subsidiaries, property, plant and equipment, and sales and returns of investments together with cash provided by \\noperating activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the business and financing activities. A reconciliation to net \\ncash provided by operating activities for the 2022 and 2023 periods is shown on page 7.\\n\\nThis press release also includes cash flow from operations excluding working capital (non-GAAP), and cash flow from \\noperations and asset sales excluding working capital (non-GAAP). The company believes it is useful for investors to consider \\nthese numbers in comparing the underlying performance of the company's business across periods when there are significant \\nperiod-to-period differences in the amount of changes in working capital. A reconciliation to net cash provided by operating \\nactivities for the 2022 and 2023 periods is shown on page 7. \\n\\nThis press release also includes earnings/(loss) excluding identified items (non-GAAP), which are earnings/(loss) excluding \\nindividually significant non-operational events with, typically, an absolute corporate total earnings impact of at least $250 million \\nin a given quarter. The earnings/(loss) impact of an identified item for an individual segment may be less than $250 million when \\nthe item impacts several periods or several segments. Earnings/(loss) excluding identified items does include non-operational \\nearnings events or impacts that are generally below the $250 million threshold utilized for identified items. When the effect of \\nthese events is significant in aggregate, it is indicated in analysis of period results as part of quarterly earnings press release \\nand teleconference materials. Management uses these figures to improve comparability of the underlying business across \\nmultiple periods by isolating and removing significant non-operational events from business results. The Corporation believes \\nthis view provides investors increased transparency into business results and trends and provides investors with a view of the \\nbusiness as seen through the eyes of management. Earnings excluding identified items is not meant to be viewed in isolation or \\nas a substitute for net income/(loss) attributable to ExxonMobil as prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation to \\nearnings is shown for 2023 and 2022 periods in Attachments II-a and II-b. Corresponding per share amounts are shown on \\npage 1 and in Attachment II-a, including a reconciliation to earnings/(loss) per common share \\u2013 assuming dilution (U.S. GAAP).\\n\\nThis press release also includes total taxes including sales-based taxes. This is a broader indicator of the total tax burden on the \\nCorporation\\u2019s products and earnings, including certain sales and value-added taxes imposed on and concurrent with revenue-\\nproducing transactions with customers and collected on behalf of governmental authorities (\\u201csales-based taxes\\u201d). It combines \\n\\u201cIncome taxes\\u201d and \\u201cTotal other taxes and duties\\u201d with sales-based taxes, which are reported net in the income statement. The \\ncompany believes it is useful for the Corporation and its investors to understand the total tax burden imposed on the \\nCorporation\\u2019s products and earnings. A reconciliation to total taxes is shown in Attachment I-a.\\n\\nThis press release also references free cash flow (non-GAAP). Free cash flow is the sum of net cash provided by operating \\nactivities and net cash flow used in investing activities. This measure is useful when evaluating cash available for financing \\nactivities, including shareholder distributions, after investment in the business. Free cash flow is not meant to be viewed in \\n\\n10\\n\\n\\n\\nisolation or as a substitute for net cash provided by operating activities. A reconciliation to net cash provided by operating \\nactivities for the 2022 and 2023 periods is shown on page 7. \\n\\nReferences to resources or resource base may include quantities of oil and natural gas classified as proved reserves, as well as \\nquantities that are not yet classified as proved reserves, but that are expected to be ultimately recoverable. The term \\u201cresource \\nbase\\u201d or similar terms are not intended to correspond to SEC definitions such as \\u201cprobable\\u201d or \\u201cpossible\\u201d reserves. A \\nreconciliation of production excluding divestments, entitlements, and government mandates to actual production is contained in \\nthe Supplement to this release included as Exhibit 99.2 to the Form 8-K filed the same day as this news release.\\n\\nThe term \\u201cproject\\u201d as used in this news release can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the \\nsame meaning as in any government payment transparency reports. Projects or plans may not reflect investment decisions \\nmade by the company. Individual opportunities may advance based on a number of factors, including availability of supportive \\npolicy, technology for cost-effective abatement, and alignment with our partners and other stakeholders. The company may refer \\nto these opportunities as projects in external disclosures at various stages throughout their progression.\\n\\nGovernment mandates are changes to ExxonMobil\\u2019s sustainable production levels as a result of production limits or sanctions \\nimposed by governments.\\n\\nThis press release also references structural cost savings, for more details see page 8.\\n\\nReference to Earnings\\n\\nReferences to corporate earnings mean net income attributable to ExxonMobil (U.S. GAAP) from the consolidated income \\nstatement. Unless otherwise indicated, references to earnings, Upstream, Energy Products, Chemical Products, Specialty \\nProducts and Corporate and Financing segment earnings, and earnings per share are ExxonMobil\\u2019s share after excluding \\namounts attributable to noncontrolling interests. \\n\\nExxon Mobil Corporation has numerous affiliates, many with names that include ExxonMobil, Exxon, Mobil, Esso, and XTO. For \\nconvenience and simplicity, those terms and terms such as Corporation, company, our, we, and its are sometimes used as \\nabbreviated references to specific affiliates or affiliate groups. Similarly, ExxonMobil has business relationships with thousands \\nof customers, suppliers, governments, and others.

If I could ask everybody to ahead and take a seat. Welcome back for the energy and carbon session, and I recognize that most of you were here in the morning session. But for those that were not here, if I could just very quickly recap some of the administrative items. First, as it relates to safety, again you'll recall that we have 2 exits out of the room. One in the\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\ntake you down the street. Again, if there's an emergency, you will hear an audible, and there will be some staff here that'll guide you as well. Again, I'll ask you to go ahead and silence any type of your electronic devices at this point.\\n\\nNext, I'll draw your attention to the cautionary statement, which can be accessed along with the presentation on our website. I'll also note that we did -- you should have a, what we call the second edition of our Energy & Carbon Summary\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nback of the room.\\n\\nSo for this afternoon, opening remarks and we'll also introduce the presenters. As shown, we plan to cover our outlook for a lower carbon future and discuss the important research that we're pursuing to identify solutions that will provide for a lower carbon energy, and then we'll wrap up with a open discussion period. And the plan will be to conclude this part, this session at 2:30 today.\\n\\nSo with that, it's my pleasure to go ahead and invite\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nDarren back up to the stage for his opening comments.\\n\\nDARREN W. WOODS, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION: Thank you, Jeff. Well, good afternoon, everybody. Welcome back to those from the morning session, and for the new folks, welcome. Welcome. In a moment, I'm going to hand the stage over to 2 of our company experts. Pete Trelenberg is an expert in the climate change field; and Dr. Vijay Swarup is our expert on low emissions technologies. And they'll describe how we look at, how we evaluate and how we address the demand for energy and the risk of climate change. That demand for energy and risk for climate change is what I have referred to in a number of the things that I've written, conversations [today]. Hopefully that you'll see we study that pretty intensely, and we have a pretty deep understanding of both sides of that equation. But before I give the stage to them to let you -- let them take you through that, I want to spend just a moment talking about the dual challenge. And I want to start with the fundamental, which is energy is essential to human progress. And most people agree with this and a very quick review of history will clearly\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nit's the UN human development Index plotted against energy use per capita, and you can see a very clear correlation. As standards of living rise, so does energy use.\\n\\nI always think it's important when we talk about this that we keep in mind, there are over 1 billion people (technical difficulty) more than half of the world's population are living at standards well below what any of us in this room would deem as acceptable, and you can see some of that in the red dots there. So consistent with that need, majority of the energy demand is in the developing world driven by growing economies, improved living standards, improved health, improved educational standards. That's what makes this problem so hard. Communities that desperately need affordable energy are growing their use of it, and that is a good thing. Lives are improving, but at the same time, they're driving the growth in CO2 emissions. And you can see that on the chart on the right. In line with their energy demand growth, the majority of emissions are coming from non-OECD countries. That's the essence of the dual challenge, providing affordable energy to people that desperately need it and maintaining that with the living standards. We believe that we have an obligation to help address this challenge. We also believe very strongly that we're part of the solution. I'm going to hand it over to Pete and Vijay to take you through how that manifests itself in our company. Pete?\\n\\nPETER TRELENBERG: Thanks, Darren. It's a pleasure to be here. Kind of the climate issue for the corporation and advise Darren and the management committee and the businesses in this space. And I work very closely with the team that puts together our annual outlook for energy, so that we can embed thinking about how the evolution of the energy system might happen as the world tries to address the dual challenge that Darren laid out, how do you supply energy for...\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nIn February we published our annual Outlook for Energy, which I'm sure most of you are familiar with. And we also published for the second time and in a much more enhanced version our Energy & Carbon Summary. So today, I'm going to take you through about 9 or 10 slides that kind of have some highlights of the energy outlook. So what's driving energy use, what's driving emissions, talk a little bit about the evolution of energy sources. So a couple slides on that. For the first time, we added into our energy outlook and then pulled those into the Energy & Carbon Summary, sensitivity analyses. I'll take you through one of those. There's 3 of them that are actually included in the energy outlook and the ECS this year.\\n\\nAnd the one I'm going to take you through is electric vehicle penetration because I can't go anywhere and talk without having a question about electric vehicles. So I'll take you through that.\\n\\nWe also included 2-degree centigrade scenario analysis, a very in-depth analysis against a number of 2-degree centigrade scenarios. So I'll take you through that. And then I'm going to close by just talking about kind of at a high level how we position the corporation to compete in a -- the evolving energy landscape and, in particular, in a lower carbon future. I'll then hand it over to Vijay to talk specifically about the importance of technology and innovation that's helping us compete in that arena.\\n\\nSo let me just start by covering some macro trends from the energy outlook out through 2040. We run our energy outlook out through 2040. And you look here, population we think increases by about 1.7 billion people, goes up to about 9 billion globally. More profoundly, the global middle class rose by almost 3 billion people. Middle-class consumers are what drives a lot of growing energy demand. They're the people that enjoy the things that we enjoy here today: lighting, heat, cooling, refrigeration, washing machines, cell phones, computers, TVs, mobility, all the kinds of things that drive demand for energy and for petrochemical products.\\n\\nGDP about doubles, led particularly by developing economies. We see those develop as well, but developing economies grow at about twice the rate of developed economies. Energy demand increases much less than GDP, and the difference between those lines quite simply is efficiency gains. And we think (inaudible) efficiency gains accelerate across this period. I'll show you couple\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nCO2 emissions increase even less. They only increase about 10%, and the difference between (inaudible) and the carbon content are the energy sources that we use, and I'll show you that as well on the next chart.\\n\\nAnd if you look at efficiency and the gradual reduction in carbon content, you get just shy of a 50% reduction in overall CO2 intensity of the global economy.\\n\\nSo then just look at global primary energy demand. You can see the growth here kind of stacked up by transport, power generation, industrial, residential and commercial. And energy demand is particularly driven by growth in transportation demand as well. So overall, the energy demand, as I mentioned, increases about 25%. And what we've shown here with a black line is what would happen if we didn't capture energy efficiency. So in other words, if the global economy did not continue to get more efficient, remained stagnant. And the importance of that, if you look at the gap between the (inaudible) about the amount of energy that the global economy\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nconsumed in 2010. So I can't underscore enough\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nThe mix shifts here, you can see within coal declines down to about 20%. Oil remains about the same and this lower CO2 emitting sources of energy, in particular gas, but also nuclear, wind and solar and other renewables actually grow and gain share.\\n\\nAnd then if we look at CO2, we see OECD, non-OECD, you can see, we think global energy-related CO2 emissions actually peak sometime in the 2030s. They flatten out, get pretty plateau and sometime in the 2030s, we actually think they'll peak. And we're relatively optimistic in our assessment of that versus some others, say, for example, the IEA.\\n\\nSo energy sources continue to evolve. You saw that mix shift in the middle chart. Oil, we think, remains the largest source of energy. Natural gas grows the most, so the most by size. And it grows and actually overtakes coal as the second largest source of energy. Coal peaks in about 2025 or so, and it actually then starts to decline. First time in history we'll ever see coal use actually peak and then decline. Coal use in the OECD has already peaked and is already declining.\\n\\nAnd then on the right-hand side, you'll see the nonfossils, so nuclear, biomass, solar wind, biofuels, hydro and geothermal. So all those sources of energy that don't produce greenhouse gas, they grow at the fastest rate\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nthink solar and wind will grow very rapidly through this period, albeit from a relatively small base.\\n\\nWe talked about one of the sensitivities. I mentioned we've done sensitivities for many, many years. For the first time this year, we actually included what we look at beyond what Darren and the management committee members talked about as far as looking at a broad price set where we evaluate our projects to see if they're robust. We also look at a number of sensitivities to test both our strategies as well as our projects to make sure that they're robust to these various sensitivities.\\n\\nSo this shows a chart of liquids demand by sector. And you can see, first of all, you see that primary growth in this sector for liquids is driven by sector growth in chemicals, petrochemical demand and in commercial transportation. So one sensitivity we ran was a sensitivity that hypothetically assumed that all vehicles, all light-duty vehicles by 2040 would be fully electric. That would require that starting about 2025, every light-duty vehicle sold would need to be a fully electric vehicle. Now I say this as a hypothetical sensitivity because we do not yet see the vehicles to make that happen. However, we wanted to test versus what we thought was an extreme sensitivity. Even assuming 100% penetration of electric vehicles by 2040, fuels demand in 2040 is about where it was several years ago, about 5 years ago or so, so 2010 to 2012.\\n\\nOne thing that's interesting when you run the sensitivity is you shift power source from liquid fuels from all the electricity sector. And because in 2040, the electricity sector is not fully transitioned away from fossil fuels, you actually have an upside for natural gas. So natural gas use actually increases with increased electric vehicle penetration, effectively because of increased power requirements. And as I said, we included a couple other sensitivities in the Energy & Carbon Summary and in our energy outlook, and so you can take a look at those as time permits.\\n\\nSo let me now transition to talking about how we looked at 2-degree centigrade scenarios. And this again, for the first time, we've looked at scenarios for many, many years. We've been very deeply involved in the community that looks at these. But for the first time, we published an analysis versus 2-degree centigrade scenarios. And we put this both in the energy outlook and then brought it into the energy and carbon summary as well. So to do this we thought we wanted to look at a range of different scenarios, and there are literally an infinite number of scenarios that can be created to try and achieve a 2-degree C, 2-degree centigrade pathway.\\n\\nThe suite of scenarios that we looked at was from a group that Stanford University runs called the Energy Modeling Forum, and the Energy Modeling Forum has been around since the late 1970s. It is one of the premier groups or premier forums where modelers in this space get together. And this set of scenarios we thought was particularly valid because it was used to form the basis of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the IPCC's AR 5. The suite of scenarios represents a broad range of outcomes, a whole 13 different pathways and each are a complete 2-degree C (inaudible). And what you see here is the suite of business as usual. So no additional policy scenario shown in here, and there's 13 scenarios. These are the 2-degree centigrade scenarios, and you see, they're very different from business as usual, very heavy dose of policy, very\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nthe emissions pathways actually go negative in the second half of the century. And what I've overlaid here is our Outlook for Energy. So a couple observations or a couple points to make. Our outlook is not a business-as-usual outlook. So let me repeat that. Our outlook is not a business as usual\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\na tightening of policy, very much consistent with the architecture of the Paris Agreement that was signed several years ago.\\n\\nOur outlook also does not yet foresee a 2-degree C pathway. We don't see the policy stringency. We don't see the finance flows. We don't see the technologies driving towards that yet. We also don't see that in the Paris agreement. We looked very closely at the nationally determined contributions. In other words, the inputs from every country that signed the treaty to the Paris agreement [agreed to] the policy intentions as submitted in the NDCs.\\n\\nThis is a whole suite. These are the scenarios. These are actually the output, and one thing to notice is there's a lot of green. That's oil. And there's a lot of red. That's gas. So all these scenarios require oil and gas out through 2040. We looked at the average of these, and you can see the variety\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nso I said there's a lot of different ways. There's actually an infinite number of ways you can model\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nthe suite of 13 models, and we had modelers, 4 or 5, from North America. So we had a variety of approaches even geographically.\\n\\nWe looked at the average, actually see an average decline rate of 0.4% per annum. So and for gas, we actually saw an increase. So gas actually grows in this scenario, and it grows about 0.9% per annum. Remember, these are the average of the 2-degree C scenarios.\\n\\nSo let me just talk a little bit about why invest in this business. I get asked this question all the time. Why keep investing in the oil and gas business? Well, it's because there's demand\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nhistoric production of liquids since 1970\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nabout through -- about 2015 , 2016. And our industry is unique in that you have natural field decline.\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nWe're on a treadmill of trying to replace natural field decline. We're in a depletion business. We need to replace that, and we replace that to meet demand. So on the right-hand side, you can see what would happen if globally, the oil and gas industry stopped investing in liquids production. And then what we've done here is looked at the average demand. Remember, I told you, average demand declines at 0.4% per year, so that ends up being about 78 million barrels a day of demand even in a 2-degree C scenario or, in this case, the average of the scenarios that we looked at.\\n\\nSo in that demand, we've kind of marked it. It's about the same as demand in 2003. So even on lowest case demands, so we overlaid -- this is the range. Remember, there was all those scenarios. So that's the range. And the range actually, even in that lowest case demand, it's still about the demand for liquids that the world saw in 1973. So this natural field decline requires trillions of dollars of investment for new liquids capacity to be brought online between now and 2040, even under a 2-degree C scenario. We didn't calculate this, but the IEA has recently come out with an estimate, and they would estimate based on their 2-degree C scenario that about $14 trillion of reinvestment in liquids capacity is required even under their 2-degree C scenario. So it gives you a feel for how much reinvestment is required to meet demand and to offset natural field decline.\\n\\nThis is the same similar chart for gas. And gas, again, I've shown gas production from 1970 up until the present. And what I said, natural gas demand actually grows. So the average of our 2-degree C cases, natural gas demand actually grows, and it grows by 0.9% per year. So that's about 20% above where we are today. So it goes from 270 up to about 445. And even under the lowest, so I overlaid the low and the high. So even under the lowest demand case, natural gas demand is still about equal to natural gas demand in 2000. So in the gas space, we need reinvestment to meet demand as well.\\n\\nSo I've got 2 more charts here. Let me talk -- I'm going to talk about the importance of efficiency and reduction -- reducing carbon. So modelers basically have 2 levers at their disposal to try and drive greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere, drive emissions down while meeting demands for energy. You can get more efficient across your economy, so that would be moving downward down the y axis, and you can get lower carbon content. And that would be moving to the left on the chart here.\\n\\nAnd what we've shown here since 1980, so the last 35 years, is what's actually happened in the world in the blue dots. And you can see the world has gotten much more efficient and a little bit less carbon intensive. And you're probably wondering what the little jog to the right is, and that's actually China. So you can see what happened when China electrified at a very rapid pace, did that mostly on coal-fired power generation and built an economy that had a lot of heavy industry. And you see the impact of China, how they drove carbon emissions or carbon content of the global energy system up. So what do we think is going to happen in the future? We've overlaid that as well, and we think the trends we're going to get back on trend. We're going to get significantly more efficient. I showed you the magnitude of that, and we think we'll gradually decarbonize.\\n\\nI also said our energy outlook doesn't project we're yet on a 2-degree centigrade pathway. And that's what this shows. This is where we would have to be, either much more efficient -- so move farther faster down the page -- or much less carbon-intensive or some combination of those 2, and that's where we would need to be on this purple line. Now we'll be watching this closely. This summer, there will be a new set of commitments by the countries who have signed onto the Paris agreement. We'll watch those closely. We'll build that back into our energy outlook. One of the reasons we do our energy outlook every year is so that we can take the latest policy, the latest technology evolution, and we can build that into our long-range planning.\\n\\nBut even if you're on that purple line, you're not finished yet because as you recall, 2-degree centigrade, 450 parts per million is a 2100 target. There is a lot of work to be done, and you need to continue to move farther and faster.\\n\\nSo how do you know how close you're getting? We watch indicators and in the Energy & Carbon Summary, we put some signposts. And again, you can take a look at those. I pulled a couple out of there. So if we were approaching that purple line versus our energy outlook, energy use per unit of GDP would be down about 50% from 2010 to 2040. Our energy outlook projects that number about 40%. So pretty aggressive on efficiency, not quite there yet. So we would also -- one of the core strategies is to reduce the carbon content or the greenhouse gas emissions or the power generation system through low greenhouse gas electricity; nuclear, solar, wind, biofuels, hydro, natural gas, carbon capture and sequestration, all of those are methods to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector. And that low greenhouse gas electricity, so the portion of that, that effectively has low or no greenhouse gas emissions. So gas with CCS and then all those sources that don't emit greenhouse gases, that would need to go from\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nin our energy outlook, we see that just shy of 50%. Again, making progress but not yet there. And then lastly, and biofuels. Biofuels actually would have to increase from about 1% of the global mix primarily used in liquids to about 15%. So in our energy outlook, we have that at about 3%. So lots of work to do in the biofuels space. Dr. Swarup will talk a little bit about the work that we're doing in that space, given the importance of that.\\n\\nLet me close with 1 slide on how we're positioning for a lower\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\ncost on these 4 pillars that I've shown here. The first is to reduce our own emissions. So Darren and the other management committee members talked about the importance of running our facilities well, and that is a lot underpins mitigating emissions in our operations. So for us, this really falls into 3 areas. One is reducing energy use. So the majority of our emissions in our operations come from energy use. We heat things up. We pump them around. We use pressure. We use temperature to make the molecules, and so reduce\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nwe work this all the way down at the shop floor, at the operator level. We've been doing it my entire career. So we've been doing it for almost 40 years at least, and we do it day in and day out. And driving that down just like we do ownership of safety, driving that energy efficiency and energy use down to the shop floor is important for us. We reduce flaring. So very important in our Upstream business that we reduced flaring. We don't like to flare. We like to save and use the gas, and we reduce flaring across our operations, particularly important in the Upstream.\\n\\nAnd then lastly, and you may have noticed some announcements recently, we reduced methane emissions. So methane is -- while they're a relatively small portion of our overall greenhouse gas emissions across the corporation, they're important. It's important that we manage those well, and we've announced a couple of initiatives voluntarily to drive our methane emissions down.\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nFor energy efficiency, we're very reliant on cogeneration. We have over 100 cogeneration or combined heat and power. It's very amenable to our operations where we have large amounts of heat, large amounts of electricity. And we've deployed that for many decades across our operations.\\n\\nSo second area, provide solutions for our customers. So we help them reduce emissions across the value chain. Chemicals and lubricants, great examples of this. Chemicals, we reduce weight. We reduce it all through the value chain. And it might not sound like much to reduce the gauge on the plastic that's used in packaging, but you multiply that by billions\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nso our Chemical products leverage a lot of greenhouse gas reducing, create a lot of value by reducing greenhouse gases across the value chain. Our Mobil 1 franchise with synthetic lubricants, another great example of how we're positioning to help customers reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, in that case, by reducing friction within the engine.\\n\\nWe also have to meet society's energy needs. And Jack talked about the shift in our Downstream portfolio and the output of the yield patterns there. Shifting away from motor gasoline, recognizing that motor gasoline for light-duty vehicles is likely to peak sometime in the 2020s and to shift that towards chemicals and towards distillate where we think most of the growth in liquids demand is. So we engage constructively on climate policy. It's where I spend a lot of my time. And by and large, we're trying to harness the market\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\neveryone across the global economy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. And then lastly, we develop scalable, low-carbon technology solutions. And Dr. Swarup, my friend, Vijay, will now cover this in more detail. Thank you.\\n\\nVIJAY SWARUP: Thanks a lot, Pete. Well, it's a real\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nExxonMobil. I'm going to give you an overview of our approach to the research and how we translate it to competitive advantage. A lot of what you heard this morning is the outcome of years of research in the lab to develop the catalysts and the processes and the computational capabilities that you heard this morning. And I'm also going to talk about our focus on where we focus and how we look to make scalable solutions that can have big impacts as we translate them from the research labs to commercialization. And as I do that, I'm going to get into some of the programs we have. I'll keep it high level, but just give you a flavor for some of the things we're working on, some of the things that are exciting us in the lab and we're convinced are going to be part of the solution mix as we move towards the lower carbon energy future. This is a technical industry. I think it's often underappreciated the disciplines that come together to provide energy. It is essentially\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nchemistry, Physics, all of those, some -ologies I don't even know, as well as every engineering discipline, chemical, civil, mechanical, electric and nuclear. All of those come together in order for us to have the energy that we enjoy, but it is certainly not new. We've been at this for decades, and we continue to believe that it all starts with fundamentals. Science-based fundamentals, understanding the basics, understanding what drives -- what are the mechanisms that drive the chemistries to\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nthat we're getting. And then we take that science-based fundamentals and then we start moving it down the value chains that you heard this morning by working on catalysts, low-emission processing and visions to scale. That's the\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\ntalk about it a little bit this morning. But to do the efficient resource capture, development and production, you need to have deep understanding of subsurface and you have to have advanced computational capabilities, 2 areas that we were pioneers in and we continue to lead in that research area.\\n\\nAnd then in chemicals technology, advantage feedstocks is actually taking advantage of feedstocks. It is understanding the unique integration of a refinery and a chemical plant, how they work into chemical. No 2 refineries are the same. So understanding the composition of the crude, how you can take that crude, feed it to the chemical plant, understanding the heat integration, to Pete's point, around how do you mitigate emissions in your own operations? Well, one is heat integration, is maximizing, optimizing what you're doing in your plant. That's the unique we can do because of a refinery and a chemicals integration. So you take that feedstock and then you get the right process to upgrade that feedstock. And as you upgrade that feedstock with the right process, you end up with a product that you want that we can then put into the marketplace. And we've been pretty good at this for a while. The chart on the right shows just some of the innovations that we've had as a corporation, going back to the '40s and we can actually go further back, but you're left half with half a slide, you try to fit it on half a slide.\\n\\nSo if you go back to the '40s, we had -- we were the innovators of high octane gasoline and the rubber, butyl rubber, which is the essence of a tire, and those were 2\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\n'60s brought 2 critical platforms into our capabilities, platform\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nand pushed the limits of. The first is catalysis with the synthetic catalyst. You heard a lot this morning about catalysts. Catalysts help you drive reactions, improve selectivity\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\ncomputational phase and energy. And those -- that's actually a digital simulator. That is how you did one back in the '50s and the '60s. And of course, today, we're using ultra high-performance computers to improve our seismic imaging, to improve our reservoir management. We continue to extend the use of advanced processing capabilities to get a better\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nwe were pioneers in lithium ion batteries, the essence of the technology that's still used today. And as we move into more recent times, we continue to extend what we're doing better and better and better. Go to deepwater development, extended-reach drilling, 2 things you heard about this morning. We keep pushing the envelope, pushing the envelope based on fundamentals, understanding the science behind the physics, the physics behind the engineering that then lets us understand how to do this safely.\\n\\nAnd then specialty plastics. You heard a little bit about this morning. We continue to push to the boundaries of lightweight and strength, doing 2 things at the same time, make it lighter and make it tougher. What does that let you do? That lets you make cars lighter, which is huge for fuel efficiency; allows you better air retention in tires, that helps you get again, better fuel efficiency; and also lightweights packaging. And so as you're shipping goods and you're trying for food preservation, a lightweight plastic wrap is huge when you're looking at overall emissions reductions. So we've been at this for a while, and we continue to do the research. What I want to do is just tie back real quick to this morning because what you heard this morning was the outcome of several years in fact, in some cases, over\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nare rooted in advantage technologies. And you heard the translation of that. It ends up being -- in growing of earnings. Jack talked about that catalysts and processes we're deploying. What he described to you this morning was taking resid, which is the bottom of the barrel. So it's the heaviest portion of the barrel. It's the portion of the barrel that has the most complicated, interrelated structure, it's very complicated materials. And you want to take that and you want to process it to make something that is essence -- in the essence of the feedstock of a motor oil. So you're going for something that is very complicated to something that has to have purity and a specification that's very narrow so that we can meet lubricant specifications. That is not easy to do, and the only way to do that is to have tremendous catalysts that can break the rings, can get you the selectivity you want, that can get you the exact product quality you want and then have separation schemes on the back end that allow you to get the purity. So the reactors do the conversions, the separators do the purity. We're pioneers in both of those. We keep extending the catalysts. Those are just some types of catalysts is what you see in the upper right. And what we do it's not just a catalyst. Our processes can have up to 10 different catalysts, and using those catalysts in the right order is critical to what we do. And we're able to understand that through our lab work, through our modeling order to take the bottom of the barrel and upgrade it to feeds to lubricants or to diesel, as Pete mentioned a minute ago.\\n\\nAnd then Neil talked about the advanced computational capabilities that underpin our Upstream business. He mentioned full-wave inversion and reservoir simulation. As I showed on the earlier chart, we've been doing digital reservoir simulation for 50, 60 years now. And on the full wave inversion, that just continues to extend our expertise and understanding subsurface through seismic interpretation.\\n\\nNow in both cases these programs that we're about to commercialize, these projects that are about to go into the field, the essence of the R&D is over 10 years old. And that's the time line we're on to go from concept to challenge a paradigm\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\ntakes time, it takes patience, it takes commitment to the fundamentals and the fundamentals ultimately drive and underpin the projects. But we know the world's changing. And as Pete said, we've got to start look at the low carbon future. And I want to shift now to our emissions reduction research with the focus areas right on that, the emissions reductions. And 2 levers that Pete talked about, energy efficiency, which is reducing CO2, CO2 reducing processes; and decarbonization, which we look at and say let's find processes that actually consume CO2. Can we make CO2 as a feed. Now below these you see some program areas, and I'll get in a minute, but I want to\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nwe don't do it linear. We want to go wide with a range of ideas. Sort of put them through a funnel, let the best ideas come out. And so with the energy efficiency piece, we're looking at existing manufacturing. There's a lot of energy in energy. And we're saying we want to reduce manufacturing emissions by over 25%. That's a big bite out of the emissions. And there's 3 processes we're looking at: Liquids conversion, essentially refining; the steam cracking portion first part of the Chemical plant; and then the polymerization, how you take that ethylene or the propylene and turn it into polymers and to the plastics that we use.\\n\\nOn the right, you can see a membrane for separations. Today, we use temperature. We use distillation. We boil to separate. That's largely the way we do separations. Instead of using temperature, which in itself implies energy, what if you use shape or size? And a membrane is nothing more than a fancy filter. So imagine a filter, you got the red balls and the blue balls, you want\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\ndon't use temperature, maybe a little bit of pressure, but you can do it at far lower energy. And we're making progress in this space. In fact, we've had some critical publications in Science magazine over the last couple of -- over the last year demonstrating proof of concept, a very, very small scale, at lab scale, but demonstrating that you can separate hydrocarbons using size as the property. And then on CO2 consuming process or decarbonization, 2 big areas we're working again, portfolio approach, lots of ideas, but a couple of them they are beginning to emerge as things where we're looking at a little harder. First one is carbon capture and storage. And I'll talk more about that in a minute, and the other is the advanced biofuels. And on the right, you see a picture of the carbonate fuel cell that many of you might have heard of or seen on TV. That's Tim Barckholtz, the primary scientist behind it standing in front of it. It's essentially a big battery, it's cathode-anode but CO2 becomes the feed. And as you're collecting CO2, you're concentrating the CO2 and you're generating electricity.\\n\\nAnd then on the right is a journal. It's called Nature Biotechnology. It's a peer-review journal, highly respected journal in the bio field. And we had a critical breakthrough last year in our biofuels program, our algae program where we discovered a way to regulate the growth of algae so that you can partition the algae to grow more lipid. And we published it, and this is in this journal. This is a peer-reviewed journal. It's very difficult to get published in it, and it's even harder to get on the cover. And that may not mean a lot to you guys, but imagine that was Fortune Magazine, okay? That's what this is like, okay? This is getting on the cover of a big-time magazine in our field. And it just shows the quality of that breakthrough, that it was recognized as a cover-worthy publication. So we're very excited about that. And I'll get into both of those programs in a little more detail in just a minute. But that's the blanket area. That's the playing field that we're on, working in these areas, portfolio approach, looking for the best ideas and then promoting those best ideas still in the research phase, but working down the pathway to development.\\n\\nLet me start with industrial processes with lower emissions and in our\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nout there, you'll see process intensification. That's what we're talking about here. Because the essence of energy and energy conversion in itself is energy intensive. And so in some ways, we're trying to take energy out of energy conversion.\\n\\nAnd there's 2 key components to an industrial process, a reactor and a separator. A reactor is where you do the conversion, and a separator, the separation place is where you do the purification. In order to rethink the way we do this, we're going to need new catalysts. That happens to be what we've doing for the last 100 years. It's right up our alley. So we're pretty confident that we can do something in this space and we're making some good progress. The chart here shows\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nand I want to talk about this because instead of starting with crude as the feed or even ethane as the feed, here we're starting with methane as the feed. Now one of the things about natural gas is its clean. There's no metals. There's essentially no sulfur, no nitrogen. And so the first part of this energy process is taking out the impurities. So if you can start with a cleaner feed, then you've already moved yourself down the field a good ways to reducing energy. Now the challenge with natural gas or methane is it's one carbon. And one carbon is very hard to activate. But with our knowledge of reactors and knowledge of catalysts, we're actually making progress here. Still early days. We're making progress with some novel reactor designs. And then you follow that up without membrane type separation that I talked about before, and you could start doing the first step of research in this field, which is what's called a flowsheet. Can you draw a flow diagram that conceptually shows a blueprint, if you will, that shows you what you're trying to do? And then can you take that blueprint and boil it back and say what's the fundamental science question I'm trying to answer? And then you set up your teams and you go after it, and that's what we're doing here. We're excited about the progress. And I hope we move to the next phase, which is a pilot plant in the near future because this is a technology that could really make a big impact.\\n\\nLet me now turn to carbon capture and storage. Carbon capture is likely going to be a key component of decarbonization, as Pete said, in just about any scenario. And we\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\ncarbon capture today. So we also know that today's process is complex and actually consumes energy. So you're concentrating the CO2, but you're actually using power to concentrate the CO2. And that's a paradigm that we've been challenging for years saying wait, we've got to break out of this. We have to be able to generate power while we're concentrating the CO2. And the way to do that is to use CO2 as a FEED. And now you're trying to find the right type of material, the right type of system that can take CO2 as a FEED, concentrate it and generate power, and that's what's shown on the right there with this carbonate fuel cell. The key word is carbonate, which is carbonate implies -- carbonate implies you're taking CO2 as a FEED in order to make the fuel cell to make the battery work. And as you're doing that, as you're taking the CO2 through, you're concentrating the CO2. So it comes out as concentrated CO2 that can then go into storage, and you're generating electricity. So that Holy Grail, that paradigm that we thought couldn't happen, we're actually doing in the lab.\\n\\nLet me talk about something else we're doing that is different. You have to evolve as an R&D organization. You just -- we don't have time be truly linear. And R&D historically, has been very, very linear. You go station to station. You do the lab, then you do a little bigger, then you do a little bigger. We're taking a different approach here. We're still in the lab. We're still understanding\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nacross the fuel-cell, but at the same time, we're constructing a pilot plant in an actual power plant because we want to understand the engineering aspects of how this fuel-cell will integrate in with the power turbine. And we're already seeing dividends for that. So as we're progressing the pilot plant to the engineering drawing phase\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nso can you design your fuel cell to do this? And the scientists are going to the engineers and saying, look, this is probably the highest temperature. This is how the heat is going to integrate. This is how we want to do this. And so what's fascinating to me, because this is sort of a new process for us to do things in parallel instead of series, is we're actually asking questions at the science level that I'm not even sure we knew we were supposed to ask. So we get it. We get that we have to get onto the low carbon solutions. We know this is going to take time, but we're doing whatever we can to speed up the learning to do the cross-fertilization development chain.\\n\\nLet me be honest with you, it's still a long way to go but the early results look promising, and I know that this is going to be something further down as we go, but we have to stick to this because we're on to some ideas. And again, this is just one of our ideas. We have portfolios of ideas in this space and we continue to progress our ideas.\\n\\nThe last vignette is on advanced biofuels. As Pete talked about, the need for diesel, Jack and Darren this morning\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nstart with just the basics, okay? You need a high energy density liquid fuel to move trucks a long distance or to move airplanes, and that's just for the physical chemistry. There's no getting around that. You need an energy density to be able to do that, and that's going to be a liquid fuel for a long time.\\n\\nAnd so we're working on this. We're working on how do you make this with a biofuel, then because a biofuel is going to consume CO2 because that's the nutrient, that's the food.\\n\\nSo we're working again portfolio, cellulosic as well as algae. Our core principles when it comes to biofuels is we don't want to compete with food. We don't want to compete with freshwater. It needs to be scalable, and it needs to be globally deployable. Cellulose don't use food, don't use the crop, use the crop residue. Essentially all crop residue is some form of the cellulose, which is just another intricate string of carbons connected that you then have to break down to sugars and from which you can convert to a fuel.\\n\\nAlgae, which is what you see in the schematic there, basically sunlight plus CO2, core components of photosynthesis. Algae grow in brackish water. They do grow fast, so they're scalable. And they grow in all geographies. So they're globally deployable.\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nin the algae to grow the types of feed -- what we call lipids, the oils, that we can then feed to basically an existing refinery. And by the way, let's start connecting dots now because if you start with algae, there is no metals, there is very little sulfur, if any. There's no nitrogen. So you have a cleaner feed. So again, the first part of a process, you're going to be taking a lot of energy out of that.\\n\\nSo with the algae, we're making progress. I talked about the publication in Nature Biotech. We are expecting a series of publications this year as we continue the research. And just yesterday, we announced again a parallel approach, while we'll continue in the lab working on the algae research, we're now going to start progressing an outdoor pilot plant, outdoor testing with a target of 10,000 barrels a day by 2025. Now that's a lot by today's biofuel standards, like that's world scale by today's biofuel standards, and we see that as a small step because we have to get to much, much larger scales to make a material impact.\\n\\nBut 10,000 barrels a day we think will teach us the fundamentals of the engineering, which we haven't really gone after yet. We've really been going after the biology the last 9 years. We've been at this since 2009, almost entirely of the algae -- of the biology. So we think there's huge opportunities again building off of our process knowledge, an algae pond is essentially a reactor. You have a solid, you have algae, you have a liquid, which is the water, and you have a gas, which is CO2. And so how do those all work together? And in fact today, it's like, the term is actually\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nbecause we think our process engineering is going to allow us to really improve that. And again, we're going to start that cross-fertilization. The engineers are going to look at it and say, I think I can get this depth of sunlight into the water. So that's how much depth you're going to get for the algae. And the scientists are going to say, okay, but if you give me this type of CO2 level, I'm going to be able to get it to grow faster. And now you're starting to connect again.\\n\\nAnd again, talk about connecting. My previous chart was on CO2 capture. You can start thinking of having an algae pond.\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nthe algae then gets processed to fuel. And you can start looking at different configurations. The key is all 3 of these, lower-emission processing, carbon capture and biofuels, become platforms for the low carbon future. And we're still a long way away, but we're pretty optimistic about what we're seeing, and we can certainly see how this can connect going future -- going forward.\\n\\nBut we can't do this alone, and I don't want to give you the impression that we're doing this in a vacuum, that it's just the scientists of ExxonMobil that are working on this. We have always collaborated, and we're continuing the collaborations, in fact, increasing our collaborations. And there's 2 types of collaborations I want to describe here.\\n\\nOn the left-hand side of the chart what we call collaborations targeting capabilities. So we're a capability-based organization and every so often, and in fact, more often than not, we are looking for who can complement that capability. And then we'll go do a targeted program with them. And you can see we have over 80 R&D collaborations complementing our capabilities. What I have is I have sort of a matrix here, 2 columns and 3 rows, and they tie back to the previous 3 charts\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nemissions and processes. We're working with 2 of the leading universities. Georgia Tech is where we're doing a lot of our membrane work. In fact, the publication we had was a co-publication with some office from Georgia Tech. And then Purdue University, which is leading edge on plant configurations and how you can reconfigure manufacturing footprints in order to improve efficiency.\\n\\nOn the carbon capture, 2 examples of small companies that we're working with. TDA Research, which is working on sort of a separation scheme to be able to concentrate the CO2. And then FuelCell Energy, the manufacturers of the carbonate fuel cell, who we're working with on the carbon capture.\\n\\nAnd on the bottom are biofuels approach. On the algae side working with the Synthetic Genomics who are pioneers in a lot of the sequencing and a lot of the understanding of the annotation of why a genome does what it does. And then REG is our key partner on our cellulosic route. So again, extending to where we don't have the core capabilities so that we can bring the right people together to take on these challenges.\\n\\nNow on the right is how we widen the aperture. Energy is wide. There's a lot going on, and you want to stay on the cutting edge of what's going on so that you can understand how everything is going to integrate together in the future.\\n\\nAnd you see 4 leading universities there at what we call energy centers. Energy centers provide efficient access to a broad range of capabilities at a particular university, and you can see these are leading universities. We were pioneers in this space, by the way. 2002 was essentially the first energy center at Stanford, and we were the founding member there. And in fact, just last week, we announced that we're going to be the founding member of the new Stanford energy center called the Strategic -- Stanford Strategic Energy Alliance. We joined MIT, Princeton and Texas. This gives us the range. This is where they're studying advanced batteries. They're studying grid-scale storage. They're studying grid optimization. They're studying advanced photovoltaics. They're studying wind\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nevolving landscape. And in fact, a lot of the pioneering in this space actually happens at the academic or the national lab level. And when we say we're engaged there, we are physically engaged there. We have scientists going up to these universities all the time, and they're engaged with the faculty working at the bench with them to understand the state of the science. So on the left, directly tied to a program. And on the right, how we widen the aperture to make sure we're aware of what's going\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nwe have the map covered. So earlier, I showed you our history and I kind of left off where Jack and Neil talked this morning.\\n\\nSo near term, it's about the stuff you heard about this morning. It's taking the technologies we've been working on for the last 10-plus years and putting them in the field. In the midterm, likely it's going to be looking at our processes and reconfiguring them to do it with lower emissions. That could be new separation schemes, that could be better catalysts. That could be better heat integration. That could be newer materials. But it's an extension of what we're doing today, and I think we're going to make tremendous progress over that.\\n\\nAnd them longer term as Pete said, we're going to need scalable widespread biofuels and carbon capture. And in both those areas, we have significant programs that are looking really promising, and we're excited about where it's going.\\n\\nSo as I said earlier, this is a technical industry, and the root of our competitive advantage is based on advantaged technology that starts with some pretty hard work.\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\ntask ahead of us. I'm absolutely confident that just as we have been for the last 100 years, been the center of a lot of the pioneering in energy, we will be in the future because you just can never underestimate the power of technology. Thank you very much. I'll turn it over to Jeff.\\n\\nQuestions and Answers\\n\\nJEFFREY J. WOODBURY: Thank you, Vijay. Thank you, Pete. So next, we're going to it open up for another open discussion and go ahead and address your questions. Once again, I just ask that -- go ahead and start with Sam there.\\n\\nSAM JEFFREY MARGOLIN, MD, COWEN AND COMPANY, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Sam Margolin with Cowen. Look, I don't want to ask you to get ahead of your skis at all, but this is an Analyst Day so I have to ask about the commercial strategy and carbon capture. It seems like you have a lot of options should this technology scale. You could simply license it or you could even bundle it to end users of your gas if you wanted to pass it through on a unit basis. And what do you guys think is the optimal commercial strategy for something like carbon capture that's really on the frontier but has a lot of obviously benefits across the board?\\n\\nVIJAY SWARUP: Yes, I think it's all of those, okay. And we didn't even talk about some of the other things that I think are going to be part of the\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nthere's a lot of academic work right now in just actually CO2 conversion. So take the CO2 and through electrochemistry, something like that, actually use that as your [carbon]. You're asking to get ahead of the skis, but the key is you've got to be able to concentrate the CO2. You've got to be able to do it scale, you've got to be able to do it at an economics that make\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nwe're working on, whether it's the algae pond to 10,000 barrels or this carbonate fuel cell, it is as modular? And so that's probably going to be the next step is to start deploying it in modular levels to understand how it best fits. But our job in R&D is to provide options to the business. The business will then write the business plans in terms of whether it's a licensing or whether it's\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nreally hard problem. This has been something that people have been chasing for a long time. It's advanced materials. It's integration. There's all the things we talked about. And quite frankly, from an R&D standpoint, we want to be laser focused and just drive to make sure we have a solution and a solution that can be scalable. And quite frankly, I think the rest will take care of itself.\\n\\nPETER TRELENBERG: Let me add to that. It's -- when we look at carbon capture, it's thought by the IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, that, that's probably the most -- single most important technology to make the energy transition to sort of net 0 carbon affordable. So it's apparent that's an extremely important technology. The other thing that I've realized is the oil and gas industry is uniquely positioned to understand that entire value chain. We already run -- as Vijay mentioned, we run about 25%, just under that, of the world's CCS capacity now. So we know this technology. We know how it runs. We know how the current technology works. Vijay talked about some advanced technology that could lower that price point pretty -- and make it simpler. So we know that. We know the midstream. And in particular, we uniquely, almost uniquely know the subsurface. It's going to be important to understand that entire value chain to make this technology work and to allow it to be deployed at the scale that it really needs to be deployed to help kind of tackle the dual challenge. Where exactly we think we're going to play in that value chain, too early to say.\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nthoughtful about that. CCS comes into the mix we think into the -- late 2020s, 2030s by the time you get to sort of the price point that pushes that into the mix and it starts to be deployed. So we got a little bit of time to figure that out and how we think we can extract the most shareholder value out of that whole value chain. Beyond that, I can't tell you. We don't know yet is kind of the answer.\\n\\nSAM JEFFREY MARGOLIN: And then just a quick one on algae, whatever you're willing to disclose as far as current yields, annual barrels for a 1-acre pond? And then what your target is to get it to scale, if that's your process.\\n\\nVIJAY SWARUP: So let me answer the second one, current 1-acre pond is, like I'd have to calculate that and get back to you.\\n\\nPETER TRELENBERG: Let me give you just a feel for it. This is about -- I want to say about 40x as efficient as growing soybeans on a per acre basis, and it's about 3x as efficient as palm oil on a per acre basis. That's sort of the current yields, and of course, Vijay and his organization are going to push that up.\\n\\nVIJAY SWARUP: Now he's going to follow-up with what's the yield of soy? And I don't know the yield of soy either, okay? But on the pathway though, I think the key here is we have to get 2 things on the algae. The\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nwe think we probably have to double it again to get where we want to go. And then the second thing is the photosynthetic efficiency. That's where the engineering aspects come in. That's basically how do you get the light to come through the water and get to as much of the algae in a uniform way as you can. So think about the fundamentals of that. It's mixing, it's light penetration, which is just physics, and so by getting out to the outdoor pond in actually true light conditions, I think we're going to learn a lot about what the optimal fit -- mixing is and how do we get those lights. So those are the 2 levers we have to turn. And then with the gene editing, which is the big breakthrough in that whole field, with the new gene editing tools -- and we actually anticipate the gene editing tools to get even better. So where we are today gives us line of sight to getting to that next step. We're not actually there today. We know we have to make improvements in all 3 of those areas, but we're confident we'll make those improvements\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Jon?\\n\\nJONATHON RIGBY, MD, HEAD OF OIL RESEARCH, AND LEAD ANALYST, UBS INVESTMENT BANK, RESEARCH DIVISION: Jon Rigby from UBS, 2 questions. The first is I think you talked about part of the -- important part of\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nand with policymakers, I guess, with everybody who has -- any stakeholder in the whole debate. So I wondered whether you could talk a little bit more, sort of characterize where you are with that? And I say that because it was very clear that one of your peers sort of put out a view of energy not dissimilar to yours and was almost accused of being a climate change denier because the scenario they were showing, which is a practical one, didn't accord with what people wanted to see. And I feel that probably direct engage\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nwhat everybody wants. And the second one, which, I guess, is related to that is, do you need a price for carbon for all of these things to work? And do the kind of prices for carbon that I think some countries currently aspire to have in place or have in place, sort of the $50, so this work can be viable?\\n\\nPETER TRELENBERG: Yes, let me take the first question on engagement. You are absolutely correct that this is a space where you need to talk about real practical solutions. And when we engage, when I engage, Vijay, others, we engage, and we like to talk about real practical solutions because that's what's going to solve the dual challenge. You saw our analysis. We don't -- right now, we don't see the\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nand yet pushing the world towards 2 degrees. We're turning the curve over, and we very clearly don't see the ambition as indicated by the nationally determined contributions as pushing that curve over. We engage across a broad spectrum of stakeholders. So we engage with environmental NGOs. We engage with shareholders who are activists. We engage with groups like this, broad-based investment community. We engage with policymakers in major thought leadership capitals of the world, whether it's Washington, Brussels, London, Asia. So we engage with academics. So there's think tanks, so a whole host of engagements that we try and talk, but we always try and talk about what are real practical solutions and they need to be scalable. And scale in the energy industry is something you cannot underestimate. So scalable. And then they need to be sustainable. So they need to be something that can be -- is sustainable in the environment. And that's kind of how we engage. And we're looking for a practical solutions and we're looking for efficient solutions. If the world had on -- the world economy or the world society had unlimited resources, we could solve all kinds of problems. We don't have unlimited resources, and so that implies a need for efficient resource allocation. And of course, we tend to think the market is an efficient allocator of resources. So when we're engaging on specific climate policy, we're trying to engage in a way that tries to harness the power of the market broadly across all sectors of the economy to try and drive the types of change we're looking for, while recognizing people need reliable, affordable, scalable energy. And that's a hard -- that's hard. That's just hard. It's a hard problem, but it requires engagement and it requires discussion on real solutions. Second question around price on carbon. That is what we advocate for and have advocated for. We advocate for policy structure that allows a price to be put on carbon broadly across the economy. We just think that's the efficient way versus sort of the patchwork of shotgun regulatory approaches that we see all over. So we just think that's a more efficient, more effective way to drive both changes in the economy as well as send a long-term signal for the kinds of investments in technology and capital stock that need to be made. I can kind of give you an idea around price point on CCS. Around $100 a ton, we think current [mean] technology coupled with gas firepower generation becomes economic. That's $100 a ton CO2 avoided cost. The technology Vijay was talking about strives to bring that cost down by 25% to 30%. So you could think somewhere around $75, $70 a ton. So -- and it's sort of that thinking why we don't see -- we think CCS comes in kind of later in the energy outlook period, starts coming in and maybe be going with the NDCs. Biofuels probably needs a higher price point than that. I don't have a number in my head. But the higher the productivity, the more productive the algae, again the technology seeks to try and bring that price point down. So it becomes a viable economic, scalable, reliable solution sooner in the mix because we need solutions. This space needs solutions. That's what we look for.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Yes. Go to the front here.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: You said with the biofuels, you're now maybe 2025. Do you go through analysis that -- what's the return if we could get that to 2020? In other words, you throw out some dates, 2025, biofuels; 2030, carbon capture. Well, what if you could bring those dates closer? What are the returns? What is the urgency?\\n\\nVIJAY SWARUP: Right. Let me do the resource and you can do the policy. Research is one of those things where you go as fast as the science lets you go. So one of the breakthroughs in the algae is actually these gene-editing tools that when we started the program in 2009, gene-editing tools weren't even invented yet. So what you have to do is you have to -- we talk about going wide and then you go deep. And when we see an opportunity to go faster, we will go as fast at the science allows us. So I don't feel like we're limited. We have tremendous support from that side of the table. So if we have an idea and we want to go faster, we have tremendous support that says go as fast as you can go. So there's nothing magical to 2025 other than\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nand like I said, we're anticipating improvements in all 3 of those areas. We'd be absolutely\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nenough incentive from our management and from, quite frankly, society that we need solutions that we're going to go as fast as we can go. I don't think this is one where if you put additional, quite frankly, just money on it, I don't know if we'd go any faster because we have to get -- it just takes time to get those scientific breakthroughs. And one of the hardest parts of the scientific breakthrough is actually understanding what you're trying to do. So it takes a long time just to define the question and then boil it down to that fundamental science question you're trying to answer. We're making a lot of progress there. And like I said, we now have line of sight to get there. We'll get there when we get there because I'm not -- 2025 is the target year. If we get there sooner, we'll get there sooner. But again, it's going to be a combination of biology tools, computers. We can sequence genomes, we can sequence so much faster today, that as you're trying to understand how to up-regulate, down-regulate you can just do it so much faster. So all those are going to come together, and so I'm confident that we will go as fast as the science allows us to go, but there's upside potential given how much -- how many breakthroughs we've made in all 3 of those areas the last 5 years. You want to talk about the...\\n\\nPETER TRELENBERG: Yes. I mean, incentives.\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nof not having the incentives in place to push that technology into the marketplace. I mean, we have technology that works. There are [plans to] deploy it only where those exist. There's an $80 a ton carbon tax in Norway, and we participate in carbon capture and sequestration in Norway. There's some incentives and a market for CO2 up near a large facility in Wyoming. We already separate CO2, so we compress it and put it into a pipeline where it's sold for EOR and eventual sequestration. And there's enough incentive there to make those viable businesses that are good for the corporation, good for the shareholder. By and large, we don't yet see adequate incentives to drive\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\ndozen different ways you can drive. You could mandate it. You can have targeted incentives. You can have tax incentives. There's all kinds of different schemes. Of course, as I mentioned, we tend to like broad-based market schemes because we just think those are most efficient. So...\\n\\nALASTAIR R SYME, MD AND GLOBAL HEAD OF OIL AND GAS RESEARCH, CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Alastair Syme with Citi. Can I just begin by saying that really do appreciate the energy outlook and appreciate the fact that it's externalized. It's a very good document. A couple of questions, and the first is just\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nand wind is quite a small part of the mix. Some of the advocates of that technology argue that, that's sort of understated because of the low losses and the fact that it's very concentrated in electrification, that its impact on the power generation sector is magnified. I don't know one way or the other, but can you help with your view around that?\\n\\nPETER TRELENBERG: Yes, and don't quote me on the exact numbers, but I think through 2025, we've got solar and wind growing around 9% per annum. And then they get bigger, and so it's just harder to grow at that kind of rate. So they grow -- maybe slow to 6% or 6.5% from 2025 to 2040. So we have pretty\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nwe've been really accurate, pretty accurate on wind. In fact, I think we've overestimated wind. I think we've overestimated solar growth over the last couple years as well, but we're starting to get both of those pretty well dialed in. The thing that limits\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nthat stacked bar that I showed on one of the charts is, is you only get about, on average, about 17% utilization out of a solar\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nArizona or Nevada, you'll get higher utilization, if you go to Germany, you'll get a lower utilization. And so it's very sort resource -- geographically resource dependent. And wind is the same way. It's very diverse across the continental U.S. It's great in the Mid-Continent. It's not so windy in the West, not so windy down in the Southeast. And so utilization in general on windmills will be about 30% or so. And so those low utilization rates, relatively speaking, compared to, say, a baseload nuclear plant that runs at around 95% of the time, 90-plus percent of the time. You have to build a lot of capacity just to get the output because of the low utilization rates. The other thing that you struggle with in those and that can be limiting, and there's a lot of work going on to try and maximize utilization, the time-shifting and location shifting are both important and will both limit how deeply and quickly they can penetrate. For solar panels, for instance, they actually match the load reasonably well, but what do you do at night? Or what do you do on a cloudy day? Or seasonal variation can actually be really significant, particularly if you're up at higher latitudes\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nthe Holy Grail answer there. But we don't yet see this really cheap widely deployable storage mechanisms to sort of allow that to -- sort of the whole economy to be run on those kinds of sources. You're going to need all\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nmolecule to pair with intermittent renewables because of its flexibility and availability. And so part of the reason we think gas is going to grow is -- one of the reasons -- drivers is, is because it pairs well with renewables. So also gives you a whole lot of environmental benefits versus, say, coal as well. So...\\n\\nALASTAIR R SYME: My follow-up was actually on storage because I noticed it was absent from the technology forward look. So where do you -- from a scientific standpoint, where you see the technology?\\n\\nVIJAY SWARUP: So we see a lot of research in that space and again, it's a scale challenge. So again, this is one of the things when you work with universities like MIT and University of Texas, they are leading institutes in storage, in batteries and now we're talking about large scale. So as Pete said, we are watching that space. We understand that space pretty well. We understand the trade-offs and the materials that are being used. And we're just -- we monitor that space to understand how it all fits -- how it'll all fit together going forward. But it has to be part of the -- it will be part of the mix going forward, but the challenge there is -- getting it to gigawatt scale storage capacity is really the challenge there.\\n\\nPETER TRELENBERG: Let me just give you -- try and dimensionalize the scale of battery. So for that sensitivity that I showed for the full EV case and again, it's sort of a hypothetical case. But battery capacity globally would have to be 50x bigger than it is now for that case to come about. So 50x on the capacity. I think passenger car energy use is somewhere 10% or less, so think about providing all the rest of that energy using batteries, and you can kind of get your head around the scale of batteries for storage. And so scale is going to be a limiting factor and the materials and the whole supply chain that goes into manufacturing of whatever kinds of storage might be deployed in the future, scale will be -- scale and ramp up and investment will be a huge issue to try and put that in. And that will just limit the rate and pace at which you can do this.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Paul?\\n\\nPAUL BENEDICT SANKEY, MD AND SENIOR OIL & GAS ANALYST, WOLFE RESEARCH, LLC: Paul Sankey. The -- what's the budget around what you guys do? Is it part of CapEx? And how much is it annually?\\n\\nVIJAY SWARUP: So we typically don't talk exactly about what the R&D is for these programs. We do talk about the billion dollars and the constancy of the billion dollars that we put into our overall R&D portfolio, of which these programs are a subset. I think the more important question than how much is where. And how are you deciding where to allocate it? And then when you see an opportunity -- because it's not $1 billion that's set to be divided this way, right? This is the call that we make in R&D and we make the proposals to our management and then they thankfully usually support us. But the idea here is go wide and then you go deep, and we just make the call based on where we see the science and where we see our capabilities. For instance, the announcement we made yesterday on the biofuels, that was actually a break-in. The gene editing and the capabilities just are moving a little faster than we thought. And so we said, it's time to go to augmented with a separate agreement with Synthetic Genomics, so we can go to the outdoor ponds. And we have a very fast track approach to go get the funding for that. And that just does a lot of things. The R&D community, we get excited because we see something, we want to go, and we have strong support to do it. And so I think that's what -- the signposts that I'd be looking at are not the actual dollars because the overall number -- and again, the constancy of purpose to the overall dollar is the important thing there that we don't sawtooth R&D. It's that constancy of purpose so we can maintain our core capabilities while we look at the programs. And then when we see programs that have promise, for instance, the biofuels announcement yesterday, we're able to accelerate and go after the next hurdle that we want to get after.\\n\\nPAUL BENEDICT SANKEY: Understood. I've seen that the Houston campus mothership thing that you've built has accelerated your R&D process, I guess.\\n\\nVIJAY SWARUP: So it certainly has helped. It certainly helped us sort of for the integration with the business. Our R&D center is actually just down the road from here. It's about an hour west of here in New Jersey is where we do our research. But certainly, the Houston campus has enabled us to integrate a lot better with in understanding the business challenges, so that we can then turn those into the science challenges that need to be solved.\\n\\nPAUL BENEDICT SANKEY: I have a\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nis very savvy. I think a very good message for the company to send. But equally it's likely because you don't think a carbon tax will ever happen. Is that fair?\\n\\nPETER TRELENBERG: No, short answer, no. I mean, we advocate for what we think is effective policy. It's just -- we need policy that harnesses the power of the market, and it doesn't have to be a carbon tax. You can have a really well-designed cap and trade that would do -- have a similar output. And so we're not sort of wed to a carbon tax. But we do think that this is at its core is a resource allocation question and a question that needs solutions. And we just think a long-term price signal in the marketplace is the way to sort of incentivize both of those things, incentivize people across the economy to be more efficient, to reduce carbon emissions, to reduce other emissions of other greenhouse gases as well. And then also, you need, this is a long-term game. So we're talking about between now and 2100 and so you need constancy of purpose. You need a policy that's durable, and you need a policy that incentivizes the types of things Vijay's talked about, long-range research. And the energy system is capital-intensive, and so you need to incentivize long-term capital investment as well. In both of those things, we think a price signal is the most effective and perhaps the only way that we can get that curve turned to even approach those 2-degree C scenarios.\\n\\nDARREN W. WOODS: Something to think about when it comes to cost of carbon in society today, it's an implicit cost. It's hidden. And so our view with a carbon tax is making it explicit is a much more effective way. And so our advocacy for a carbon tax is, let's get rid of the inefficient ones that are hidden and buried that society is paying today and is not motivating and driving the right kind of behaviors, and let's make it explicit. And that is a more efficient process and the economy benefits from that and business benefits from it, and it drives better solution sets. That's why we're advocating for a carbon tax. Okay?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Ryan, all the way in the back.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: It's [Chris Coopman] from Bank of America. You've outlined you expect coal demand to decline. Wouldn't you expect that to be reversed at the least if we assume large-scale commercial availability of CCS technology?\\n\\nVIJAY SWARUP: Let me give you a technical answer to that, okay? And that is that gas is clean burning. And so because of that you make the Downstream processes that much easier. So the first thing you have to do Downstream of a coal processing is take out all the impurities, take out the sulfur, take out the nitrogen. You're taking a step backwards when you do that because you have to cool down the stream, clean it up, heat it back up to do whatever CO2 conversion you want to do. So if you actually are absolutely getting -- trying to get the lowest CO2 footprint, and you want a scalable solution, gas is the preferred choice for that reason, number one. The second reason is we didn't really talk a lot about storage here today. We certainly know a lot about the subsurface, such as what the sequestration and storage is going to be. And remember, with natural gas, you get half the CO2 of coal. So it's a better quality CO2, if you will, cleaner, less energy intensive to process and you.\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nyou would, scientifically, you'd go after gas.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: And I suppose, assuming that both cost the same.\\n\\nVIJAY SWARUP: Well, you have advantages with the gas, which should also level that off. But again, you get -- from a science standpoint you say, what's the right science solution? And then you get to the things that Darren was talking about, and that should level it off. But technically, you want to start with as clean a fuel as you can, and that's natural gas.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Quick second question, if I may. You've also outlined one of the first steps as part of your policy is to reduce your own emissions. A large-cap peer of yours has announced 2050 targets that include not just cutting their own carbon footprint, but also the carbon footprint of their customers. Is this something you would ever contemplate? Or do you think this is not a smart communication strategy?\\n\\nVIJAY SWARUP: I think we want to go to a lifeline.\\n\\nDARREN W. WOODS: No, I think if you listen to the things that the guys have talked about, what this program is focused on is, first of all, understanding the size of the problem, understanding what the applicable solution sets are and where the technology solution sets are. So if you look at one of the charts that Pete showed on the carbon emissions, you've got 3 sectors: power generation, transportation and industrial. And the point of the discussion is there are gaps in solution sets in all 3 of those. So if you're going to get to 2 degrees C, if you're going to meet the aspirations that came out of the Paris accord, you got to find a new solution set. You have to augment what's out there today. That's what we're talking about doing today is finding a way to fill the gap that exists today, look for a technical solution. And then the work that we do around\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nand that continues to be a grassroots activity that we continue to drive. And the growth that we talked about this morning on the Chemical front is driving all the emissions reductions with the lighter materials, more efficient processes, so that whole package is driving emissions down, and that's what we're focused on, driving that as far as we can as economically as we can.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Okay, we got time for just one more question. Rob, go ahead.\\n\\nROBERT WEST, PARTNER OF OIL AND GAS RESEARCH, REDBURN (EUROPE) LIMITED, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Rob West from Redburn. I'm going to ask a question that exposes my own ignorance. It's how the enormity towards algal biofuels. So in your presentation, which was great. Sorry for asking a hostile question, the presentation was very good, but I just generally don't understand it. So there's a fuel that's come down the cost curve. You can go to sunny places around the whole world. You can produce usable kilowatt hours straightaway. What are the metrics where algal biofuels could beat that in terms of overall energy in to energy out or cost? Is that...\\n\\nVIJAY SWARUP: Yes. I'm going to give you\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\ndown to is photosynthetic efficiency is really what you're asking about, okay. And you're basically asking, are you better off with a solar panel that's absorbing in the photon and turning it into an electron? Or are you better off by taking the sunlight plus the CO2 and turning it into a lipid that can be further processed?\\n\\nROBERT WEST: At a like -- at a...\\n\\n(technical difficulty)\\n\\nVIJAY SWARUP: Yes, so solar panels, the physics behind the solar panel we studied for years, and we continue to study -- and they keep getting better with the triple junction is what they call it now, so you can do more conversion. But we think that you're going to hit a limit of physics there. So the algae where you're bringing in CO2 and sun, so now you're taking 2 things that are essentially out there, and you're converting into the fuel we think has higher upside potential for the scale that we want to get to is really what it comes down to. So the scalability aspects of algae for a biofuel we think has tremendous upside potential.\\n\\nROBERT WEST: So you talked about having to double it again. But could you give us anything around the sense of what is the bull cycle capture rate of sunlight to usable energy as you have it on today's technology? It wasn't a well-phrased question was it?\\n\\nVIJAY SWARUP: No.\\n\\nROBERT WEST: The sun comes in and hits a solar panel, you convert maybe...\\n\\nVIJAY SWARUP: You're talking about the solar efficiency? You're talking about the solar efficiency of a solar...\\n\\nROBERT WEST: On a photovoltaic panel, you're getting maybe 13%, as I see it?\\n\\nVIJAY SWARUP: Yes, 13%, yes, right. Right.\\n\\nROBERT WEST: Well, what's the number today on if that same amount of sunlight hits your algae and then on your algae, what percentage do you end up at?\\n\\nVIJAY SWARUP: Yes. So don't look at that. What we look at is we look at basically photosynthesis, which is sun plus CO2 that gives you the lipids. So we're trying to take a fixed sunlight and we're turning it into the lipids. So I'd have to get back to you if that's okay, on exactly trying to make an apples-to-apples comparison on that.\\n\\nPETER TRELENBERG: Yes, let me just give you one thing to think about. Energy density,transferability, the rate and pace at which you can transfer energy are all important in certain applications. Energy density is paramount. So weight and time are paramount. That's how that industry operates. It's hard to envision in our lifetime electrifying aviation. And so for those kinds of applications and, by and large, commercial applications, so commercial transport, time and weight and energy transfer rate are all important. And so a liquid fuel where you store energy in the hydrocarbon bonds is hugely valuable in those applications because of that energy density. And so while declining costs of solar photovoltaics are important for us to understand, and we build that into our energy outlook, there are applications where electrons, you just can't store electrons very effectively. And that's getting better. But that will have its limitations. And just the ability to transfer electrons into batteries I think will end up being an important limiter. And then infrastructure ends up being important. So if we can produce an algae biofuel and we can produce a distillate that looks like current distillate, all your infrastructure is already in place, and so you get a big -- you get a scalable application that utilizes existing infrastructure. So all of those things are things we think about as we do the energy outlook, but I think there will be a place for solar photovoltaics, no question about it, in the energy mix, but there will also be a very important place for liquid fuels of some sort, both in transport but also important in industry as you think about how would you reduce carbon across industry. With that, we're probably out of time.\\n\\nJEFFREY J. WOODBURY: Right. Ladies and gentlemen, thanks again for your interest, your time. And of course, we are looking forward in the future to meet with you and talk about the progress on our business.

Ladies and gentlemen, good morning and welcome to ExxonMobil's first-quarter earnings call. My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the investors section of our website.\\n\\nBefore we go further, I'd like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on slide 2. Turning now to slide 3, let me begin by summarizing the key headlines for first-quarter performance. ExxonMobil earned $1.8 billion in a difficult business environment marked by low commodity prices. Cash flow from operations and asset sales totaled $5 billion in the quarter. These results demonstrate the durability of our integrated business enhanced by our relentless focus on managing those factors that we can control including effective cost management, reliable performance and operational integrity. A highlight this quarter is our strong chemical results, which underscore significant gas and liquids cracking advantages at our integrated sites and differentiated capabilities across the value chain.\\n\\nThe Corporation also continues to make steady progress on its investment plans. During the quarter we benefited from recent capacity additions while reducing CapEx 33% versus the prior year quarter. We continue to effectively manage our spending while selectively investing in the business to meet long-term energy demand and importantly grow shareholder value.\\n\\nMoving now to slide 4, we'll provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. Global economic growth remained weak during the first quarter. In the US estimates indicate growth has slowed further since late 2015. In China, growth continued to decelerate. However, economies in Japan and Europe seem -- showed some modest improvement compared to the fourth quarter. Crude oil prices were quite volatile and decreased relative to last quarter while natural gas prices continued to fall. Global refining margins weakened on lower distillate demand and continued surplus inventory. However, chemical commodity and specialty margins strengthened on lower feed and energy costs.\\n\\nTurning now to the financial results as shown on slide 5. As indicated ExxonMobil's first-quarter earnings were $1.8 billion or $0.43 per share. The Corporation distributed $3.1 billion in dividends to our shareholders. CapEx was just over $5 billion, down $ 2.6 billion from the first quarter of 2015 reflecting continued steady progress on our investment plans. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $5 billion, and at the end of the quarter, cash totaled $4.8 billion and debt was $43.1 billion.\\n\\nNext slide provides additional detail on sources and uses of cash. Over the quarter, cash balances increased from $3.7 billion to $4.8 billion. Earnings adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items in our ongoing asset management program yielded $5 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses of cash included shareholder distributions of $3.1 billion and net investments in the business of $4.5 billion.\\n\\nDebt and other financing increased cash by $3.7 billion, which included an impact of anti-dilutive share purchases. ExxonMobil will continue to limit share purchases to amounts needed to offset dilution related to our benefits plan and programs but does not currently plan on making additional purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Earlier this week, the Board of Directors declared a second-quarter cash dividend of $0.75 per share, a 2.7% increase from last quarter marking our 34th consecutive year of per-share dividend growth.\\n\\nMoving on to slide 7 for a review of our segmented results. ExxonMobil's first-quarter earnings decreased $3.1 billion from the year-ago quarter. Our upstream and downstream earnings were partially offset by stronger chemical results and lower corporate costs. The corporate effective tax rate was 19% during the quarter down from 33% a year ago reflecting changes in our segment earnings mix and one-time favorable tax effects reported in the corporate and financing segment. On average, corporate and financing expenses are anticipated to be $500 million to $700 million per quarter over the next few years.\\n\\nIn the sequential quarter comparison shown on slide 8, earnings decreased by $970 million as stronger chemical results partly offset lower upstream and downstream earnings.\\n\\nTurning now to the upstream financial and operating results starting on slide 9. Upstream earnings decreased $2.9 billion from a year-ago quarter resulting in a segment loss of $76 million. Sharply lower realizations decreased earnings by $2.6 billion. Crude prices declined by almost $18 per barrel and gas realizations fell more than $2.25 per thousand cubic feet. Unfavorable sales mix effects reduced earnings $100 million. All other items decreased earnings another $250 million where lower gains on asset sales and less favorable tax effects were partly offset by reduced operating expenses.\\n\\nMoving to slide 10, oil equivalent production increased 77,000 barrels per day or 1.8% to more than 4.3 million barrels per day compared to the first quarter of last year. Now liquids production was up 260,000 barrels per day or 11.5% driven by capacity additions from recent project startups and continued good facility reliability across the portfolio. However, natural gas production decreased 1.1 billion cubic feet per day or 9.3%. Growth from major projects was more than offset by regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands, field decline, divestment impacts, and lower entitlement volumes.\\n\\nTurning now to the sequential comparison starting on slide 11. Upstream earnings were $933 million lower than the fourth quarter. Realizations decreased earnings by $1.2 billion where crude declined more than $8 per barrel and gas fell almost $0.75 per thousand cubic feet. Favorable volume and sales mix effects improved earnings by $170 million including contributions from new projects and higher natural gas demand. All other items added $140 million reflecting lower operating expenses partly offset by lower favorable tax effects.\\n\\nMoving to slide 12. Sequentially volumes were also up 77,000 oil equivalent barrels per day or 1.8%. Liquids production increased almost 60,000 barrels per day up 2.3% from ramp-up of new project volumes. Natural gas production was up 120 million cubic feet per day reflecting stronger seasonal demand in Europe partly offset by regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands and lower entitlements.\\n\\nMoving now to the downstream results starting on slide 13. Downstream earnings for the quarter were $906 million, a decrease of $760 million compared to the first quarter of 2015. Weaker refining margins reduced earnings by $860 million, partly offset by $100 million of all other items primarily favorable foreign exchange impacts.\\n\\nTurning to slide 14, sequentially downstream earnings decreased $445 million as weaker margins reduced earnings by 470 million. Unfavorable volume and mix effects mainly from increased European maintenance activities decreased earnings by another $150 million. All other items provided a partial offset adding $170 million mostly from lower expenses.\\n\\nMoving now to chemical results starting on slide 15. First-quarter earnings were $1.4 billion, up $370 million versus the prior year quarter. Stronger commodity margins from liquids cracking in Europe and Asia increased earnings by $250 million. Higher global sales volumes contributed $80 million while all other items added another $40 million, again, from lower expenses.\\n\\nMoving to slide 16, sequentially chemical earnings increased $390 million due to stronger commodity and specialty margins. Unfavorable volume and mix effects were more than offset by lower expenses.\\n\\nTurning now to slide 17, as you may be aware, Standard & Poor's reduced its credit rating on ExxonMobil by one notch to AA+ with a stable outlook. Earlier this month Moody's reaffirmed its AAA credit rating on the Corporation with a negative outlook. We want to be clear that nothing has changed with respect to the Corporation's conservative financial philosophy or prudent management of its balance sheet. Our ability to access financial markets on attractive terms remains strong. ExxonMobil's financial strength remains a significant competitive advantage and enables us to create long-term shareholder value despite near-term market volatility. ExxonMobil has a long history of prudently managing our capital structure and financial capacity through numerous commodity cycles, and we fully expect to manage through this one under those same prudent financial principles.\\n\\nMoving now to slide 18 and an update on upstream projects and the exploration program. Four major project start-ups year-to-date added 170,000 oil equivalent barrels per day of working interest production capacity. In January the Heidelberg project in the Gulf of Mexico started up several months ahead of schedule and under budget. Heidelberg is a five well subsea development in 5300 feet of water tied-back to a central truss spar production facility with a peak capacity of 80,000 barrels of liquids and 80 million cubic feet of gas per day.\\n\\nIn Australia, train 1 of the Gorgon LNG project started up in March. As you know LNG production has been suspended due to mechanical issues which the operator is actively working to resolve. In April, ExxonMobil started up two more projects ahead of schedule and under budget. Julia in the Gulf of Mexico and the Point Thomson initial production system on Alaska's North Slope. Julia is a capital efficient subsidy tie back to an existing production facility, another example of ExxonMobil's capable to cost effectively develop new deepwater resources by leveraging existing infrastructure. Production will continue to ramp up in the coming months as two additional wells are completed.\\n\\nAt the Point Thomson project two injection wells will work in tandem with the production well cycling up to 250 million cubic feet of gas per day through an on site central processing facility to extract about 10,000 barrels per day of condensate. Notably, the project provides a foundation for future gas development on the North Slope and further demonstrates ExxonMobil's ability to safely and responsibly execute complex projects in challenging and remote environments. Two additional major projects are expected to come online later this year, namely Kashagan and Barzan, closing out the six major project start-ups planned for 2016.\\n\\nTurning now to our exploration program where we continue to pursue and evaluate high-value resource opportunities. Offshore Guyana we completed the largest proprietary 3D seismic survey in our Company's history, and we are currently drilling the Liza-2 appraisal well. Data from the appraisal well and the 3D seismic will be used to evaluate the block's potential and development concepts. We do plan to drill additional exploration wells with the existing rig.\\n\\nOffshore Uruguay we are participating in the Raya-1 exploration well in block 14 where we have a 35% interest. And in the Gulf of Mexico we were the apparent high bidder on five new exploration blocks in lease sale 241. Final award of these blocks is expected later this year, and we will further strengthen our 1.1 million net acre position offshore. We plan to utilize proprietary seismic imaging technology and continue to build a portfolio of attractive future drilling opportunities.\\n\\nSo in conclusion, ExxonMobil remains focused on creating value through the cycle. We are advancing self-help initiatives, driving down costs, increasing efficiency, improving reliability and capturing incremental margin across the integrated portfolio. First quarter the corporation earned $1.8 billion in a difficult business climate benefiting from structural advantages in our downstream and chemical operations. Integrated business generated $5 billion in cash flow from operations and asset sales.\\n\\nWe continue to successfully progress our investment plans, increasing upstream production volumes from 4.3 million oil equivalent barrels a day while reducing CapEx and upholding our reputation as a reliable operator. ExxonMobil paid $3.1 billion in dividends during the quarter sharing the Corporation's success directly with our shareholders, and we remain steadfast in our commitment to pay a reliable and growing dividend. That concludes my prepared remarks, and I would now be happy to take your questions.\\n\\nQuestions and Answers\\n\\nOPERATOR: Thank you, Mr. Woodbury.\\n\\n(Operator Instructions)\\n\\nOur first question comes from Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI.\\n\\nDOUG TERRESON, ANALYST, EVERCORE ISI: In the downstream volume for both gasoline and distillate seem to be weaker than the industry markers during the quarter and also over the past year. My question's twofold, one, how much of the weakness can be attributed to items such as divestiture, unscheduled down time, et cetera, what is the real apples to apples comparison for the Company. Two with these results I wanted to see if you had a little more color or maybe a more specific read through into the key economies around the world. You touched on it at the outset Just wanted to see if you had a little bit more specifics in that area.\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Yes, I think on the first item I'd tell you just stepping back a little bit on the downstream our fuel margins were weaker with distillate margins being at five-year lows due to as your much aware global surplus capacity and high commercial inventories and obviously that was aggravated by a warm winter and low heating oil demand. Particularly in the US less demand in the energy sector, although gasoline margins remain strong and demand is growing above capacity growth.\\n\\nWe saw as I said in my prepared comments that from a volume perspective, we had increased maintenance activity predominantly in Europe in the first quarter of this year. If you compare it sequentially, first quarter to fourth quarter we had a much higher load on planned maintenance. I will say broadly speaking, Doug in 2016 our overall planned maintenance will be lower than 2015, but we will have a fairly heavy first half.\\n\\nDOUG TERRESON: And then maybe a read-through, little bit more specific read-through into the global economy. I mean these numbers were weak. I think you highlighted that, but do you have anything else to add to your comments earlier?\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: No, I mean I think I would step back more so from a macro on supply and demand and if you look at the last decade overall demand has increased about 1 million barrels a day, maybe a little less than that, and if you look at demand growth here in the last two years plus this year, 2014, 2015, and into 2016 as to what we expect, we're seeing demand growth in excess of our -- of the ten-year demand growth. I think it's a good indication of pretty healthy demand increase, very consistent with our outlook for energy with oil growth growing about 0.6 of a percent per year and gas growing about 1.7% or 1.6% per year.\\n\\nDOUG TERRESON: Okay. And in second Jeff, but return on capital and valuation have declined versus the previous cycle for most energy companies, and I think that prompted one of your competitors to indicate that returns, even at the expense of growth would probably be their new path forward, and so while Rex made pretty clear that returns were still important for ExxonMobil, but my question is whether there's been any specific movement towards maybe changing the future balance between spending and shareholder distributions, or do you guys think that as pre productive capital normalizes that the situation will resolve by itself? So how do you guys think about that?\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: From a macro perspective we're constructive on oil and gas demand. We have maintained a very disciplined capital allocation approach with a longer-term horizon. That hasn't changed. We've been through these down cycles before.\\n\\nWe've built this business to be very durable in a low-price environment, and we've maintained the financial flexibility throughout in order to continue to take advantage of opportunities whether they're at the top of the cycle or at the bottom. The return on capital employed continues to be a very strong focus for us. You've heard us talk in the past, Doug, about a strategic decision years back to go ahead and invest in a number of major upstream projects concurrently in order to capture a very unique value that probably no one else could capture like ExxonMobil.\\n\\nThat had a draw, a burden on the return on capital employed for a period of time, but rest assured, all those investments are being tested across our average financial performance to ensure that we are adding accretive value, and we still view the return on capital employed as a key metric in the end as to how effective our value choices are.\\n\\nDOUG TERRESON: Okay. Great, Jeff, thanks.\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Okay.\\n\\nOPERATOR: And our next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.\\n\\nEVAN CALIO, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Hi, good morning, Jeff.\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Good morning, Evan.\\n\\nEVAN CALIO: Okay, my first question is on unconventional,, you're running close to 96 rigs at the peak of the last cycle down to 16 today, four in the Bakken, the Permian given the environment. I know -- I know you presented a significant potential growth for Exxon but I just want to understand how you -- somewhat related to Terreson's question, how are you thinking about activity in a recovery?\\n\\nYou have a lot of options, a rigorous process. Is there an oil price, is it excess cash flow target or even a fund edge fundamental outlook in supply demand that will drive your swing in the shorter cycle resource? In a recovery that is.\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Yes. Well, let me ask you to think about it this way, Evan. It really -- for ExxonMobil it really starts at the macro level with our view of supply and demand.\\n\\nAs I explained to Doug a moment ago, we've been very constructive on long-term energy demand. For our long cycle investments it's really a function of project maturity that actually maximizes value best keeping in mind our prudent financial management to ensure that we're meeting our commitments and maintaining financial flexibility.\\n\\nNow for the shorter cycle investments that you're really asking about, by and large it is the same, but with a much narrower focus on the near-term business climate, so it's not really a price trigger for us. It's really a combination of all the relevant factors to ensure that we're maintaining our very prudent financial management, but at the same time ensure that we have financial flexibility, continue to invest when the opportunities come along.\\n\\nAnd as, I mean we're spending $23 billion this year, which represents a lot of investment activity.\\n\\nEVAN CALIO: I mean, I know you're -- there's a great consistency to your approach through the cycles and through time. Yet, do you see the allocation changing in any way favoring a shorter cycle resource versus more conventional allocation given some of the changes that could be evident through the cycle, through the forward cycles. I'll leave it at that.\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: I think, Evan, it's a good question and probably worthy of a more deeper discussion at some times. The mix of shorter cycle and longer cycle has changed over time. Obviously as our inventory base grew in the lower 48 unconventional, but our fundamentals or how we manage the business hasn't changed at all, and the choices that we're making are really driven by how do we maximize shareholder value.\\n\\nAll these investments compete, and as we've said previously, we are not opportunity constrained. We've got a very, very deep inventory across the portfolio, not only in the upstream but also in our downstream and chemical business and in just making sure that when we progress a project, an investment decision, that we have identified the optimized value proposition for it, and it's competing for that capital across the portfolio.\\n\\nSo it -- I wouldn't tell you that we ever sat targets around segmenting the total investment program between long cycle and short cycle. It's just a -- the factors I talked about a moment ago, making sure that we're the investments have matured, that we believe we've maximized value, and that we maintain prudent financial management and ensure that we can meet all of our commitments and retain our financial flexibility. But we've got a very deep and diverse inventory of investment opportunities.\\n\\nEVAN CALIO: Okay. Thank you.\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Thanks, Evan.\\n\\nOPERATOR: And our next question will come from Brad Heffern from Royal Bank of Canada Capital Markets.\\n\\nBRAD HEFFERN, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS: Good morning, Jeff.\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Good morning, Brad.\\n\\nBRAD HEFFERN: I was wondering if you could put a finer point on the chemicals performance during the quarter. It seems like it was a little stronger than maybe the macro environment would have suggested. I think you cited cost savings or operating cost savings in your prepared remarks, but is there any more detail you can provide around it?\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: There's been really good -- step back again here for a moment. Also very constructive on chemical demand growth growing about 1.5% above GDP, and that really sets up the investment proposition going forward. If you -- if you look across the segment, commodities have been growing pretty strong, very tight, particularly in Europe and Asia, demand growth has been growing much quicker.\\n\\nIt really sets up a really good investment proposition into the future. The margin benefit is primarily feed in energy dropping quicker than product realizations. I'd also say, though, that our gas crackers continue to be advantaged, even though the liquid crackers margins have improved, the gas crackers here in North America continue to have a very advantaged feed stock slate that allows us to compete very strongly in the demand market globally.\\n\\nBRAD HEFFERN: Okay. Thanks for that. And then looking at CapEx, I think the number for the quarter is pretty well below in terms of a run rate basis the 2016 CapEx guidance. I'm curious if you're expecting, seasonality in that number or if there's a reason to expect that's going to increase meaningfully going forward or if you're actually, truly below the CapEx on a run rate basis.\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Yes, Brad, so just to set the stage. As you all remember, our CapEx for 2016 is down 25% set at about $23 billion. The organization has not taken their foot off the pedal. They continue to work towards identifying capital efficiency opportunities.\\n\\nWe're still capturing market savings, and importantly and I'll emphasize this, is that we're delivering our major projects on schedule and on budget and in many cases ahead of schedule and below budget. All of that is translating into capital savings that you're seeing in the first quarter of this year. We're not going to change our capital guidance at this point, but I'll tell you that we are -- we're making great progress.\\n\\nI'll just say for a moment that the organization has really responded to a low price environment in a very effective way. They keep very focused throughout the cycle but particularly in the bottom of the cycle, I mean really risen to the occasion and continues to identify substantial opportunities for the corporation to save both cash and OpEx.\\n\\nBRAD HEFFERN: Thanks Jeff.\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: All right.\\n\\nOPERATOR: And our next question will come from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\\n\\nDOUG LEGGATE, ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH: Thanks, good morning, everyone. Good morning, Jeff.\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Good morning, Doug.\\n\\nDOUG LEGGATE: I also have a couple of questions if I may. My first one is really about somewhat specific on the oil sands business. It's been a fairly large part of your, the project rules and the shift towards liquids and so on, but obviously in this environment I have to imagine it's a substantial drag on your cash margins.\\n\\nI'm just wondering if you could -- to the extent you can just give us some idea what the economics of [carol] and your oil sands business generally Coldlake and so on looks like in this environment, and what I'm really thinking about is the kind of free cash [pork] that could generate in a recovery scenario. I've got a follow-up, please.\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Yes, I mean generally speaking the oil sands certainly no doubt profitability's compressed in this price environment, but the organization once again keeps very focused on the fundamentals, particularly our costs and reliability, and they're making really good progress. They're finding structural enhancements that create margin at the bottom line.\\n\\nIf you think about the resource base that we've got in oil sands, we've been working the oil sands now for over three decades including technology development, and on the mining side, I think [curls] are great example where we applied proprietary technology that was able to reduce our capital investment, our operating costs and improve our environmental footprint that will increase long-term value.\\n\\nThe same is true for the in situ operations. We've been optimizing our cyclic steam operations at Coldlake for a long time. We're identifying additional technology benefits like solvent assisted -- steam assisted gravity drainage technology that will improve, once again, the recovery and lower our costs and improve our environmental footprint.\\n\\nI think it's a testament to how ExxonMobil manages its portfolio. We work the project management and execution very, very well, and then when it starts up, they just keep on working on that cost structure and create margin, because we know we can't count on price.\\n\\nWhat we've got to count on is the things that we control, that being cost and reliability and our integrity of the operations. But the last point I'd make is remember, we also get value across the full value chain, because our upstream is fully integrated with our downstream and chemical business.\\n\\nDOUG LEGGATE: Right, right. Jeff, my follow-up and I'm going to have a stab at this one. It might be a very short answer, but on Guyana, I'm going to frame my question like this. My understanding is that the appraisal well is something of a two-stage effort, stage one being pre before the drill stamp test, and I'm just curious the extent you can share with us whether that well has achieved its objectives and the additional plans perhaps to being a second rig and any comments on additional prospects that have been identified at this point. I realize it's early but just looking for any update you can share on that objective.\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Sure Doug, and I understand the interest that you and others have about Guyana. I mean, we were certainly very encouraged by the discovery well. The organization moved quickly to get a drill ship contracted and get it on site to appraise the Liza discovery.\\n\\nThe well spud in February we do plan to drill multiple wells this year. Liza 2 is progressing according to expectations. We will plan to test the well, and we should complete that activity mid-year.\\n\\nAs I said in my prepared comments, we did complete the 3D seismic survey on the Stabroek block, and we began a survey on the Canje block which we picked up to the east of the Stabroek block. The well and seismic data is being assessed realtime in order to provide insights into the discovery and the ultimate block potential.\\n\\nWe do plan on moving the rig from the Liza appraisal well over to a new prospect to the northwest after it is done at Liza.\\n\\nDOUG LEGGATE: All right. Jeff, I appreciate the answer. Thank you.\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: You're welcome.\\n\\nOPERATOR: And our next question comes from Sam Margolin from Cowen and Company.\\n\\nSAM MARGOLIN, ANALYST, COWEN AND COMPANY: Good morning.\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Good morning, Sam.\\n\\nSAM MARGOLIN: There's actually quite a bit of enthusiasm developing for NGLs in the US right now among the investor community. I was wondering if you could offer sort of a -- an outlook on how that might impact Exxon going forward in the context of your sort of overall gas outlook and, you could even get more esoteric regarding heat content and all the benefits you might see in your unconventional gas business given the fact that US upstream earnings have been dragging a little bit here for the past few quarters,.\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: It's a good question, because it really highlights the benefits once again the business that we've got from the resource territory in unconventionals in the US all the way through to our chemical business. What's important is that we have built the chemical business to have a very wide flexible range of feed stock capability including ethane, propane, butane, all the way to gas oil.\\n\\nSo we've got significant flexibility within the chemical business to modify the feed stock in order to maximize margins. I'd say the same is true for Europe and Asia, particularly in Asia-Pacific in our Singapore refinery -- cracker that we have an unprecedented range of feed stocks including the ability to crack crude oil which is an industry first.\\n\\nSAM MARGOLIN: Okay. Thanks. That's very helpful. And secondly on M&A, I think Mr. Tillerson was pretty clear at the analyst day that the organization is not interested in kind of taking on encumbered assets, but ExxonMobil has pretty good currency here, and I was wondering just in the context of whatever S&P's reasoning was in the revision if there's an opportunity to maybe equitize through M&A or asset additions or if that's even a factor considering that Moody's still has the stable rating.\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Sam, I'd tell you nothing has really changed on how we manage our portfolio. Asset management contains the potential for accretive assets through acquisitions. As we've talked previously, and as you heard from Rex that we keep very alert to where there are potential value propositions to high grade our existing portfolio.\\n\\nWe're only going to pursue those acquisitions that we think have strategic value and are going to be accretive to our long-term returns, and it's got to compete with the existing inventory opportunities that we've got. We've got to be patient. ,We want to make sure that we keep a very wide aperture on what the opportunities look like.\\n\\nI think we've got a good handle on where there are opportunities, but we need to make sure that it is value accretive to the business. And once we are able to lock in on an opportunity like that, you'll hear about it.\\n\\nSAM MARGOLIN: Thanks so much. Have a good one.\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Thank you.\\n\\nOPERATOR: And our next question comes from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan.\\n\\nPHIL GRESH, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: Hey, Jeff, good morning.\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Good morning Phil.\\n\\nPHIL GRESH: First question on the quarter, you mentioned some color on the tax rate. It sounds like you separated it into two pieces. One was mix and the other was some one-time effects in the corporate and financing segment, and it sounds like the corporate and financing piece you expect to kind of revert to the $500 million to $700 million a quarter.\\n\\nI was just curious maybe on the mix side, kind of what drove that and if you think about the full-year tax rate would you expect that to still be similar to last year at current oil price levels?\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Yes, on the mix side I tell you it always has to do with the -- the relative contribution between US, international, between upstream, downstream, and our chemical businesses, and you can just sense from my comments that there's a lot of complexity in that. In terms of what -- excuse me.\\n\\nIn terms of what to expect going forward, I'd say if we were talking about, 2015 commodity prices our guidance would stay at an effective tax rate of between 35% to 40%. Now, if we're in a lower commodity price environment like we saw in the first quarter, we're probably looking at something less than 30%.\\n\\nPHIL GRESH: Okay. That's helpful. Second question is just a follow-up on the balance sheet. Looking at it slightly differently, your absolute debt levels are now around $43 billion and just kind of wondering how you feel about that comfort-wise as you look through the cycle. In a better environment with more cash flow, is debt pay down on an absolute basis in any way a priority or would you be thinking about other uses of cash?\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Well, I mean we'll obviously one of the considerations when we think about our capital allocation is retirement of debt, so we'll keep mindful. But, remember, we've got a very strong balance sheet. We will look at, the relative decisions around investments in the business, the pace of investments, our commitment to our reliable and growing dividend, and then, appropriately consideration on long-term debt levels.\\n\\nIt's all about maintaining prudent cash management, maintaining our financial flexibility. We'll continue to be disciplined in our investment approach. We're not going to forego attractive opportunities, but we'll continue to assess our cash and our funding operations -- options around a range of options and take a very balanced approach on how we go forward in our capital deployment.\\n\\nPHIL GRESH: If I were just to clarify, would debt pay down be a priority over buybacks?\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Yes, I really -- that's a decision that would be taken by the board that will be a function of a lot of factors, Phil. I wouldn't -- I wouldn't leave you with any impression that there's any prioritization that I'm conveying.\\n\\nPHIL GRESH: Yes, okay. Thanks.\\n\\nOPERATOR: Our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays.\\n\\nPAUL CHENG, ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: Hey, guys, good morning. Jeff, I have two questions, the first one may need a little bit more detail. Just let me know. If we're looking at the economics, have you talked to your downstream people whether right now economic to bring naphtha into the US gasoline pool or that you're better off to ship naphtha into your cracker for the petrochemical in Europe or Asia.\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Paul, are you asking about bringing naphtha.\\n\\nPAUL CHENG: From US --\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Importing it into our -- into the US?\\n\\nPAUL CHENG: No, no, exporting from you-- either because I mean in order to -- still have excess naphtha in this country so the question that I have is have you discussed it with your refining and chemical colleagues whether it's more economic for them to take the naphtha and they bring it into the -- into the gasoline pool in the US or that to export it into the overseas such as in European or in your Asia petrochemical to use it there.\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Yes, we maintain tremendous flexibility on our feed stock options, and that's a realtime optimization that we're managing, and we'll optimize those feeds based on the best available returns. That's moving -- that's including moving feeds between continents.\\n\\nPAUL CHENG: Yes, but just curious do you have any prior insight that you can share at this point that how's the economic -- the shift, is it more in favor of branding into the gasoline pool in this country or it is exporting?\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Yes, Paul I really don't have anything else to share on it other than to say it's a dynamic issue that we continue to optimize, and I would say that we are very well-positioned to ensure that we're making the best value choices with respect to our feed stock slate.\\n\\nPAUL CHENG: The second question is that for the Point Thomson you mentioned in your remark that also give you a [pet form] or a demonstration for potentially in the future, Alaska [air and g] project. Let's assume if the Alaska air and g won't go ahead and is really not economic at all, is the Point Thompson still a good investment by yourself without that purpose?\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Yes, I would tell you, Paul, that we look at these decisions on a long-term, and, given the constructive view what we think gas is going to do over time, we are confident that the Alaska gas will be commercialized. As to how that actually happens it may vary from what we're currently considering, but,, the -- we have been very active with our partners and the state to identify the highest value opportunity in order to commercialize that gas, and it's going to compete on a global perspective. What's going to be really critical is getting transparent predictable and stable fiscal structure in place in order to make sure that it underpins such a significant investment.\\n\\nPAUL CHENG: . All right. Thank you.\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Thank you, Paul.\\n\\nOPERATOR: And our next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil.\\n\\nBLAKE FERNANDEZ, ANALYST, SCOTIA HOWARD WEIL: I was hoping you could share little more about the rationale of the dividend increase. I know during analyst day you provided a cash flow break even potential in 2016. It sounds like during your remarks today you had eluded to some capital efficiency and maybe potential for capital to be moving down, so I didn't know if it would be fair to think that cash flow break even number has potential to potentially move down and if that played into your thoughts around the dividend increase?\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Yes. I think when you're referring to the -- the cash flow neutrality slide that we shared with you during the analyst presentation, and if you recall, it's just a -- it's a perspective of how we're managing our cash and how we manage the business, and the organization is always trying to reduce that cost structure and improve the ultimate margins, and you're correct.\\n\\nI mean we had a -- we feel fairly confident that -- that we can achieve cash flow neutrality into the future. I mean, the -- what we shared with you during the analyst meeting was a very wide range on prices, but one that's reasonable with the low end being $40 flat real, and you can see that we have good potential to reach that cash flow neutrality particularly in 2017 forward.\\n\\nAs I said earlier, we continue to reduce our cash expenditures and making good gains. But I would tell you that when we make the decisions around capital allocation, it's a consideration of a lot of factors. We're going to balance our long-term investment with our shareholder distributions.\\n\\nNothing has changed, but I'll tell you that we remain very committed to that reliable and growing dividend.\\n\\nBLAKE FERNANDEZ: Okay. Great. The second one is just kind of project specific. I know you mentioned Kashagan coming on line later this year. I think there were some press reports that could get pushed out to 2017. Can you remind me I believe Exxon was slated to take over operatorship. Are you formally controlling the new flow on that, or are you relying on peers at this point?\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: No, the -- Kashagan is managed by the North Caspian Operating Company. What you may recall hearing is that was structured in a more conventional manner, and ExxonMobil seconded the director for NCOC. In terms of timing, what we're doing there is we're replacing the on shore offshore gas and oil pipelines where NCOC is, and they're making good progress. They're progressing as per planned with intention to complete that by the end of this year and start up the facility.\\n\\nBLAKE FERNANDEZ: Okay. Thanks a bunch.\\n\\nOPERATOR: And our next question comes from Asit Sen from CLSA Americas.\\n\\nASIT SEN, ANALYST, CLSA: Good morning Jeff. The two upstream questions, one on upper Zakum and one on west Africa. On upper Zakum in Abu Dhabi, Jeff, there were talks to expand capacity to over 1 million barrels per day. Could you update us on the current thought process on expansion and where production is currently? And secondly on west Africa, Exxon had decent success last year in starting up new projects [kazambanagolaenera] in Nigeria. How would you characterize the current operating environment in some of the key countries given all the reported fiscal stress. I know it's probably a generic comment but any color would be helpful.\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: On upper Zakum, current production is around 500 -- or 650,000 barrels a day. It's -- the project itself is progressing well to increase capacity ultimately to 750,000 barrels a day. We are continuing to evaluate the opportunity to expand to a 1 million-barrel a day development, so really nothing more to share on that. On west Africa --\\n\\nASIT SEN: Jeff, on the time frame for 750,000 is what time frame.\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Getting up to that full 750?\\n\\nASIT SEN: Yes.\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: I don't recall by -- probably around by 2018.\\n\\nASIT SEN: Okay.\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: On west Africa like you said we've made some really good progress, but just a broad comment about globally, with country budgets feeling the strain of low energy prices, it is slowing down investment globally, and that is a challenge to make sure that we progress those investments at a pace that is consistent with the resource owner. I'll say that we have a very strong inventory of opportunities in west Africa, but we've got to do it consistent with confidence in the fiscal basis in which we're making those investments.\\n\\nASIT SEN: Thank you.\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Okay. Thank you, Asit.\\n\\nOPERATOR: And our next question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo.\\n\\nROGER READ, ANALYST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC: Thank you. Good morning.\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Good morning, Roger.\\n\\nROGER READ: I guess if we could talk maybe a little bit about cost deflation kind of where you're progressing both on the CapEx and the OpEx side and whether kind of consistent with one of the questions asked earlier, if there was any seasonal component to that we should be thinking about.\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Yes, so just a recap for the results that we had last year. We were able to reduce our total CapEx and cash OpEx by about $16 million year-over-year representing about a 16% decrease. In terms of going forward in 2016, nothing's really changed. We continue to manage the cost side as we always have focusing on structural efficiencies, market savings while maintaining operational integrity.\\n\\nI'll tell you Roger, we still believe there's significant opportunity in streamlining the business and reducing the cost structure, and I'd say it's -- while it's early in the year we're seeing a similar trend line as to last year. But we will maintain that relentless focus on cost regardless of whether we're in a low-price environment or in a high-priced environment.\\n\\nJust to give you a bit of a perspective, again, being very early in the year our upstream unit costs for OpEx are down about 9%.\\n\\nROGER READ: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And along those same lines, at this point oil prices rebounded. The market's starting to thinking about an ultimate recovery in drilling activity.\\n\\nDo you take advantage? I mean, consistent with your view on there's a lot more costs to get out. Is this a point at which you'd want to sign contracts, kind of lock in service capacity, service pricing, kind of anywhere around the world really.\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Well, I mean I would say Roger that in the downturn we have been high grading our service providers, and we've been locking in more favorable, more efficient service contracts. So it's not something that we had stopped doing. I mean, one of the advantages of ExxonMobil is that we're able to invest through the cycle.\\n\\nThat means that in a down cycle, we're continuing to spend a significant amount of money to capture value opportunities associated with that down cycle. So, of course the organization, and you've heard me talk previously, Roger, about the global procurement business, but it's all focused around finding the lowest life cycle costs, and you're correct to say that in a low-priced environment there are some unique opportunities that we want to lock into.\\n\\nROGER READ: Okay. Thank you.\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Thank you.\\n\\nOPERATOR: And our next question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.\\n\\nNEIL MEHTA, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS: Hey, good morning, Jeff.\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Good morning, Neil.\\n\\nNEIL MEHTA: So clearly $48 Brent's not a great price but it's a heck of a lot better than $30 a barrel Brent so it feels like this market is moving in the right direction. Demand is growing, and we're seeing signs now an OPEC supply is coming offline. I just want to reconcile that with your view.\\n\\nDoes Exxon believe that we are starting to see the signs of a sustained recovery in energy prices, particularly crude, and because you get to see the world through your portfolio, one of the big debates is is a non-OPEC supply outside the US really rolling over because of the decline rates? Are you seeing evidence that supply outside the US is actually falling off?\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Yes. The first thing I'd say, Neil, and it's really a good thought around how the macro's looking and how the sector will respond to it. I'd say first and foremost is that remember, we are price takers. We are not counting on price growth.\\n\\nWhat we are focused on is really maintaining a focus on the things that we control in order to create margin, so regardless of what it's going to do, it's going to do it, and we're going to keep focused on the things that we control. Second thing I'd say and it's just a little more expansion of what I was sharing with Doug earlier is that underlying demand growth has been generally strong, and we expect this year will be in excess of the ten-year average.\\n\\nNow I would say that in the first half of 2016, we're still over-supplied by about a million and a half barrels per day. We do expect to see convergence in the second half with the seasonal demand groaned growth but that's going to widen in the first half of 2017. And remember, during this period of over supply we've been building up commercial inventories since about year-end 2013.\\n\\nSo thinking forward, we are seeing a convergence over supply and demand into the future, but we've got this overhead of supply that's going to also have to work off over time. So we're headed in the right direction. In terms of how and when that will happen will be anybody's guess.\\n\\nRemember there's still a bit of uncertainty in terms of the supply trend and the economic growth near-term, but clearly we're seeing as you're all aware, we're seeing North America supply dropping off pretty significantly now.\\n\\nNEIL MEHTA: I appreciate that, Jeff, and then two questions, related questions here, first is any update on Torrance and then second what's the latest on Groningen?\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Yes, so on Torrance, we have completed the repairs of the electrostatic precipitator, and that we have received the approval from the regulator to go ahead and start operations. So, there's a number of things that we need to do to get it up, and, capacity demonstrated, but we do expect the formal change and control to happen mid-2016.\\n\\nNEIL MEHTA: And Groningen?\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: On Groningen, as you know we continue to have a pretty significant impact on volumes in the quarter. It was close to 600 million cubic feet a day. We have made our -- [nam] has made the submission for the new production forecast going forward, and my understanding is is that the regulator will review that by September of this year. Right now the cap is at 27 billion cubic meters, but it has the potential to go up depending on what demand requirements are.\\n\\nNEIL MEHTA: All right, thanks Jeff.\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: You're welcome.\\n\\nOPERATOR: And our next question comes from Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research.\\n\\nPAUL SANKEY, ANALYST, WOLFE RESEARCH: Jeff, I was looking back at the interview that Rex Tillerson gave after the analyst meeting when he was asked about the triple A rating, and what he said quite specifically is that there's been periods where Exxon's financial metrics have been worse than they are today, but you still retained a triple A rating, and obviously as you mentioned in your remarks, you have been downgraded by S&P.\\n\\nNaturally I went to S&P and what I saw there was the comment that maintaining production and replacing reserves will require higher spending from Exxon. So it seems that given the financial metrics are not the issue, that it seems there's an upstream issue that S&P is concerned about.\\n\\nCan you talk about your ability to maintain production and reserves at the current level of spending and address whether or not they're correct in thinking that you are going to have to spend a lot more to maintain reserves in production. Thanks.\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Sure, Paul. First off I'd remind everybody that we've got a very large inventory of investment opportunities, over 90 billion barrels of resource in our portfolio, and if you recall in the analyst presentation, we provide a little bit more insight as to the type of projects and their potential capacity they can bring on over the time horizon. Now of course what we need to do is we need to make sure that as we mature the inventory of projects, we're doing it with the greatest value proposition, and I think we've made great strides in finding unique opportunities in order to reduce the cost structure going forward.\\n\\nI'd say, though, Paul, that we've been through these cycles for a long time. We've been able to maintain a very strong balance sheet. We've maintained our financial flexibility through the ups and downs, and, our inventory looks very attractive going forward. So we think all the elements are set right to continue invest in an attractive way to maintain our lead on industry return on capital employed.\\n\\nThe other point I'd remind you is as we showed in the analyst presentation,, we have done very well in terms of efficiency of deploying investment dollars. If you'll recall, the upstream capital efficiency chart that we used in an analyst presentation showing our capital employed over proved reserves clearly we're distinguishing ourselves relative to others.\\n\\nPAUL SANKEY: Okay, Jeff, because of time constraints, I'll just jump into the other one. You again, mentioned return on capital employed. I really struggle with you losing money in the upstream on an earnings basis, particularly in the US, and how you reconcile that with the measure of the return on capital employed. Typically we don't look at that, we look at the cash flow measure. Can you help us with the DD&A upstream particularly in the US so we can get to the cash returns that you're making as opposed to these losses upstream.\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: We've got a very strong portfolio in the upstream, and remember that we invest with a long-term view that's informed by our long-term energy demand outlook. All of our assets were managed to maximize returns through the life cycle with the objective of maintaining positive cash flow in low price environments. We'll continue to focus on those things that we control, cost, reliability, operational integrity.\\n\\nImportantly, we'll invest in attractive opportunities throughout the cycle that further enhance the asset profitability, and we see significant value in our assets, so, yes, there is a low price. We're in a low price period like we've been in the past. As I've said we've really designed these assets to be very durable during a low price environment.\\n\\nThey continued to generate -- our producing assets continue to generate cash flow, and over the long-term we will continue to demonstrate,, industry leading returns on capital employed.\\n\\nPAUL SANKEY: Okay. Thanks.\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Thanks, Paul.\\n\\nOPERATOR: And our next question comes from Anish Kapadia from Tudor Pickering Holt.\\n\\nANISH KAPADIA, ANALYST, TUDOR, PICKERING, HOLT & CO. SECURITIES: Hi, yes, just had a question on,, project execution. I think Exxon has clearly shown leadership amongst your peers on project execution over the last few years, but Exxon doesn't seem to have sanctioned any major upstream projects of note the last couple of years, and do we see anything on the horizon to be sanctioned for this year, so I'm just wondering how' d you intend to benefit from the quality of your project execution if you're not progressing with projects of the moment.\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Thanks for the question, Anish. I tell you that we will announce our FIDs after the Company's made that funding decision, so we really don't project it. But as I indicated just a moment ago, we gave you an insight through our analyst presentation and F&O as to the type of projects that we're currently working on, and we've really taken this down cycle as an opportunity to retest the value proposition for each one of these investment opportunities, and there are some incremental benefits that we're able to capture through, anywhere from design changes to different ways to execute the project given the service market to fiscal basis.\\n\\nSo, this is a good opportunity to step back and make sure that we're really capturing the most value from these investments. So we gave you some line of sight on the upstream. I'll just remind you that we've got ten major projects still underway in the upstream that will start up between 2016 and 2017 as well as we maintain a very active, high-value work program, and we gave you some insight on that during an analyst presentation as well with a very deep inventory of opportunities.\\n\\nSo in summary, I'd tell you a large inventory of investment opportunities that are in various stages of planning and execution. When we get to the point where we've made an investment decision, we'll share that publicly, but the pace will be consistent upon project maturity to maximize value and our prudent financial management. And then of course remember, Anish, that we've got a lot of -- a number of very large investments underway in our downstream and chemical business.\\n\\nANISH KAPADIA: Okay. Thank you. And just one follow-up more specifically on Nigeria because you've got a number of projects that appear to have been in your project queue for a number of years, the [sandfly] field projects, the [Uge Bosso Bossy] fields, and I see you've added yet another project Awawa west into for that project queue.\\n\\nJust wondering what -- what was kind of prevented you from sanctioning some of those projects been around far long time, and what needs to change in Nigeria for you to be able to go ahead with project?\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Yes, I tell you that some of these projects are a function of optimizing the design all the way through to getting alignment with partners and establishing the right fiscal basis to go ahead and make the investment.\\n\\nANISH KAPADIA: Thank you.\\n\\nOPERATOR: And our next question will come from Edward Westlake from Credit Suisse.\\n\\nEDWARD WESTLAKE, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE: Good morning Jeff, great call so far, very informative. Just on gas, we've got over supplied markets in the US and Europe and in Asia. Now clearly the best cure for gas prices being low is low gas prices. Demand will probably pick up as a result of the time.\\n\\nCan you give us a sense of the magnitude of potential gas declines across the portfolio as you exercise [captain bis]across the next four or five years?\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Yes, you're talking with respect to our portfolio, Ed?\\n\\nEDWARD WESTLAKE: I'm really thinking about base business. Obviously we know that you've got some new projects coming on stream operated by others like Gorgon, et cetera.\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: You've seen in our volumes that our gas volumes have dropped off,, in part, and largely in the US but in part that is due to a switch from gas drilling to higher value liquids drilling during this down cycle. Gas, Ed, we continue to be very constructive growing at about 1.6% per year, primarily driven by the power sector L&G, we expect to triple from current capacity between now and 2040.\\n\\nSo I think we've got the long-term value proposition well within our sight, and it's just pacing those investments consistent with that demand growth to make sure that we capture full value for it, but we've got a very deep inventory of gas, and if you look at our proved reserves, it's somewhere around 45 to 48 percent of our total proved reserves, comparable source of our reserve base, and importantly it adds significant value to the value chain. It provides an advantage for our steam cracking here in North America.\\n\\nYou may recall that we're in the progress of progressing the expansion over at bay town, adding another 110 tons per annum of cracking capacity, and in conjunction adding polyethylene lines over at Mont Belvieu. So,, it's got a significant component of our future, very deep inventory, pace will be a function of demand.\\n\\nEDWARD WESTLAKE: Maybe a specific on Asia gas. You went I think from 4.1 down to 3.8 in the quarter. You mentioned PSE impacts in gas, maybe just run through what's happening there. Is it sort of customers are exercising low DCQs on the L&G contracts or is there something else going on?\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Three major -- three major drivers there. One was planned maintenance. Second one being asset management, some divestments, and the third one being price impacts.\\n\\nEDWARD WESTLAKE: So you're not seeing customers exercise low quantity 9contolernaces]?\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Well, I mean I really can't talk about specific contracts, but it's primarily driven by the three items I shared with you.\\n\\nEDWARD WESTLAKE: Okay. Thanks very much.\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Thank you, Ed.\\n\\nOPERATOR: Operator. And our next question will come from Iain Reid from Macquarie.\\n\\nIAIN REID, ANALYST, MACQUARIE RESEARCH EQUITIES: Hi, Jeff.\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Good morning.\\n\\nIAIN REID: Couple of questions for you. You talked about the North American US low 48 liquid productions falling, but ExxonMobil's [price] isn't falling It's going up. Is this a kind of deliberate decision to invest counter cyclically.\\n\\nYou talked about your long-term vision, et cetera, or is it something specific to your acreage where, you're getting more barrels out of your existing wells? Because, you're contributing to the problem rather than the solution if you're growing your low 48 volumes. And I've got a follow-up after that. I tell you Ian that as I said earlier that we're able to continue to invest in the down cycle, and that provides an opportunity for us to capture lower cost structure in the investments that we're making. So particularly in the lower 48 unconventionals, it's allowed us to high grade the rig activity, we're down quite significantly in terms of our peak rigs were in excess of 60. Now we're down to about 16. We have reduced our activity materially.\\n\\nSo continue to pursue the attractive unconventional opportunities that we have predominantly in the Permian Bakken, and we're getting great value for it, so it just shows the value proposition that ExxonMobil is able to provide, because we have the capability to invest through the cycle. Okay. And my follow-up question is on chemicals. Obviously very strong numbers in this quarter. The environment is obviously pretty favorable out there in terms of natural gas prices as feed stock and also the fact there's a lot of maintenance activities out there so lower production but looking a little bit further forward, there's more volumes coming on stream, your building capacity as well.\\n\\nDo you see this kind of chemical cycle at the peak now and then going into a bit of a trough toward the second half of this year and into next year, or does Exxon have a kind of -- a more kind of positive view of the market.\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Yes, I mean currently olefins and polyolefins have been pretty tight, and demand is continuing to grow, and it's outpacing capacity additions. And I think that's an important investment opportunity. Remember, this is all our investment decisions, Iain, are really founded on our view of long-term demand, and on the chemical side as I mentioned earlier we expect demand to grow about 1.5% above GDP.\\n\\nNow I'll tell you that underlying demand growth across the olefins, polyolefins, the aromatics, our specialties, has been fairly robust. Now sometimes the supply, the capacity additions are outpacing that, and that's what you're seeing for instance in paraxylene, but broadly speaking the demand is robust, and it's going to continue to grow, and we think it presents some investment opportunities.\\n\\nIAIN REID: Even with the growth in ethylene supply that we're looking at in the US over the next year or so?\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: That's correct.\\n\\nIAIN REID: Okay. All right, Jeff, very helpful. Thank you very much.\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Thank you, Iain.\\n\\nOPERATOR: And we have time for one last question, and that will come from John Herrlin from Societe General.\\n\\nJOHN HERRLIN, ANALYST, SOCIETE GENERALE: Yes, thank you. Just a quick one for me, Jeff, on Guyana. You have multiple structures in your lease area. In the event that you have multiple successes should we consider Guyana to be kind of an analog to what you did in Kizomba a while back in terms of design one, build many. And then my other question is can you bring some of these longer cycle projects forward to take advantage of excess E&C capacity today?\\n\\nYou did discuss kind of how you're optimizing things. Can you bring longer cycle programs forward to take advantage of a lower cost environment?\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Yes, yes, on Guyana, John, and good morning, John. I'd tell you that,, as I -- as I indicated earlier, it is really early days. We need to get a better handle of the full block potential.\\n\\nBut kind of the question around design one, build many, we're doing that across all of our businesses, and the -- I tell you the real modifier in that is,, design it once but continue to get more and more efficient in that design and reduce the cost structure, so it's a -- I would tell you it even expanded globally in terms of how you look at concurrent developments in different parts of the world to make sure that you're fully capturing the benefits of a robust design and execution.\\n\\nTo your point around the engineering and construction contractors, yes, I mean their backlogs are certainly light, and we are very mindful about pacing the investments to make sure that we maximize value, but we want to do it with a clear view on prudent financial management and maintaining our financial flexibility going forward, but I tell you that one of the best opportunities that we have out there is the collaboration that we've been able to have with many of our providers in really encouraging them to bring forward lower cost solutions to see if we can make investments move quicker.\\n\\nJOHN HERRLIN: Great, thanks.\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Thank you, John.\\n\\nOPERATOR: And that concludes today's question and answer session. Mr. Woodbury, at this time I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY: Well, thank you. To conclude, I just want to thank you all again for your time and very good questions. It was a insightful discussion I think for all of us, so we appreciate your time this morning, and we very much appreciate your interest in ExxonMobil. And we look forward to talking with you in the future. Thank you.\\n\\nOPERATOR: This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Our integrated business model, long-standing commitment to the integrity of our operations, and disciplined approach to prudently invest and meet long-term demand growth continue to position the company to benefit from robust industry conditions.   \\n\\nBefore we go further, I'd like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement. Please note that estimates, plans, and projections are forward-looking statements. Actual results including resource recoveries, volume growth, and project outcomes could differ materially due factors I discuss and factors noted in our SEC filings. Please see factors affecting future results and the form 8-K we furnished this morning, which are available through the Investor section of our web site.   \\n\\nPlease also see the frequently used terms, the supplements to this morning's press release, and the 2006 financial and operating review on our web site. This material defines key terms I will use today, shows ExxonMobile's net interest in specific projects, and includes our SEC regulation G disclosure.   \\n\\nNow I'm pleased to turn your attention to the third quarter. ExxonMobile's third-quarter net income and normalized earnings were $9.4 billion, down $1.1 billion from 2006 record third-quarter results, primarily due to lower downstream and chemical margins.   \\n\\nEarnings per share were $1.70, reflecting continued strong earnings performance and the benefits of our ongoing share purchase program.   \\n\\nBefore I discuss specific business results, I'd like to share some of our recently achieved milestones. In the upstream, the Ormen Lange deep water natural gas project off the coast of Norway began production this quarter. At full production the development will produce more than two billion cubic feet of gas per day. The gas will be exported through the longest subsea pipeline, approximately 750 miles to the UK.   \\n\\nFirst production was also achieved this quarter from the ExxonMobile-operated Marimba North project, offshore Angola. The project was completed ahead of schedule and within budget. This is the first tieback development to the Kizomba A infrastructure to cost effectively develop new capacity by utilizing existing field facilities. The project will develop 80 million barrels of oil and have preproduction capacity of 40,000 barrels per day.   \\n\\nOn October 12, gas deliveries from the Statfjord Late Life project started out via the Tampen Link pipeline in the Norwegian North Sea. This project will increase ultimate recovery from the field by 360 million oil equivalent barrels and extend field life up to 2020. Peak production is expected to reach 360 million cubic feet of gas per day and 70,000 barrels of crude and condensate per day.   \\n\\nThese three startups, together with the projects which began production this year, RasGas Train 5 and Cutter, Waddenzee in the Netherlands, and Rosa offshore Angola bring our 2007 to-date major project startups to six.   \\n\\nIn exploration, we had several notable milestones this quarter. ExxonMobile was awarded two exploration licenses, offshore western Greenland, further enhancing our strong portfolio of Arctic exploration opportunities. The West Disko block four and block six together cover over six million acres and are in 150 to 1,300 feet of water. In the recent central Gulf of Mexico lease sale ExxonMobile was the high bidder for 13 offshore blocks in the Gulf of Mexico, totaling over 70,000 acres.   \\n\\nAlso this quarter, together with our partners, we made a new discovery in the ultra-deep MTPS block 100 miles off the coast of the Republic of the Congo. The Cassiopi well was drilled to a depth of approximately 10,000 feet and tested at 5,600 barrels of oil per day. ExxonMobile interest in the block is 30%.   \\n\\nThese milestones continue to reflect the geographic diversity and strength of our industry-leading upstream portfolio.   \\n\\nIn the downstream, our fee diversification activities continued this quarter. We ran 34 crudes that were new to individual refineries and three that were new to ExxonMobile.   \\n\\nWe also maintained focus on our margin enhancement strategy which includes increasing the contribution from our refining operations through reliability improvements and effective technology deployment, while incrementally adding to our crude and conversion processing capacity.   \\n\\nAlso in the third quarter, ExxonMobile launched our fuels marketing joint venture in the Fujian province of China with our partners Sinopec and  Saudi Aramco. This venture, which is part of our fully integrated Fujian project, covers wholesale sales of gasoline, diesel, and other petroleum projects. ExxonMobile's investments in the Fujian refining, petrochemical, and fuels marketing joint ventures demonstrate our commitment to advantage strategic downstream and chemical investments to meet growing demand around the world.   \\n\\nIn our chemical business, ExxonMobile announced that we will build a second world-scale petrochemical project at our integrated refining and chemical facility in Singapore. The new project will include a one million ton-per-year ethylene steam cracker, polyethylene, polypropylene, specialty elastomer and benzene units, and expansions to our existing oxoalcohol and paraxylene units. ExxonMobile will construct a 220-megawatt co-generation unit as part of the overall investment.   \\n\\nThis project with the expected startup in 2011 will be key to meeting the growing demand for ExxonMobile chemical products in Asia. The project will employ ExxonMobile's latest proprietary technologies, enabling a broad range of feed stocks to be processed and converted into premium products.   \\n\\nIn the quarter we also announced our investment to expand the paraxylene and benzene production facilities at our Rotterdam Aromatics plant by 25% and 20% respectively. The new production unit will employ ExxonMobile's proprietary PxMax technology which increases paraxylene production and improves process efficiency.   \\n\\nExxonMobile chemical also began commercial production of butyl rubber at the Notre Dame de Gravenchon facility using proprietary breakthrough technology. This technology improves energy efficiency and enables significant capacity increases at existing facilities.   \\n\\nThe integration of these new projects into our existing refining and chemical operations are further examples of our strategy to develop and rapidly deploy differentiated technologies and selectively invest in advantage projects to capture the full benefits of integration across all ExxonMobile operations.   \\n\\nTurning now to the business line results.   \\n\\nUpstream earnings in the third quarter were $6.3 billion, down $200 million from the third quarter of 2006. Improved crude realizations were more than offset by reduced natural gas realizations, higher expenses, including the impact of major project startups, and lower property sales. Worldwide crude realizations were $71.46 per barrel, up $6.32 from the third-quarter 2006. Upstream after-tax unit earnings in the third quarter of 2007 at $17.47 per barrel, were in line with last year. In total, oil equivalent volumes were down 2% from the third quarter of 2006.   \\n\\nAs you're aware, on September 6, ExxonMobile filed a request for arbitration with the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes following the ex-appropriation of assets in Venezuela in June.   \\n\\nExcluding Venezuela volume effects as well as entitlement, divestment, and quota impacts, production was actually up 3% in the third quarter. That increase was driven by increased volumes from major project ramp-ups in Russia, West Africa, and Qatar, which more than offset natural field decline.   \\n\\nTurning to liquids production.   \\n\\nVolumes fell by 111,000 barrels per day, or 4% from the same quarter last year primarily due to entitlement effects in Africa and the absence of Venezuela volumes. Venezuela accounted for about 40% of the reduction.   \\n\\nNatural field decline was offset by project-related increases in Russia and West Africa. Gas volumes were up 163 million cubic feet per day from last year as higher production in Qatar, primarily due to the startup of RasGas Train 5, more than offset field decline in mature areas.   \\n\\nNow turning to the sequential comparison.   \\n\\nVersus the second quarter of 2007, upstream earnings increased by nearly $350 million. Higher realizations were partially offset by lower liquids production and seasonally lower natural gas demand. Liquids production decreased 5%, including the impact of entitlement effects in Africa and the absence of Venezuela volumes. Natural gas production was down 5%, primarily due to lower volumes in Europe, reflecting seasonally lower demand, divestment effects, and scheduled maintenance.   \\n\\nFor further data on regional volumes, please refer to the press release and IR supplement.   \\n\\nNow turning to the downstream results. Third-quarter downstream earnings were $2 billion, down approximately $735 million from record results in the third quarter of 2006. Lower margins reduced earnings by $610 million with decreases in refining and fuels marketing margins, partially offset by improved lubes marketing margins.   \\n\\nVolume mix effects increased earnings by $120 million as we benefited from our continued focus on feedstock flexibility, capacity utilization, and product optimization. These more than offset the impact of the higher planned turnaround activity. Other items reduced earnings by $250 million, reflecting increased maintenance activity and the absence of positive tax effects in third-quarter 2006.   \\n\\nSequentially, third-quarter earnings decreased by almost $1.4 billion, due to markedly lower refining margins. Volume mix effects were positive $110 million, due to lower planned maintenance in the US and refinery optimization activities. Other factors reduced earnings by $240 million, primarily the absence of positive impact from the Inglestadt divestment in the second quarter.   \\n\\nThird-quarter chemical earnings were $1.2 billion. Earnings were down $150 million versus the record third quarter of 2006 as higher feedstock costs more than offset increased realizations. Positive mix effects benefited earnings by $30 million. Other factors increased earnings by $65 million, including positive tax effects.   \\n\\nSequentially, third-quarter chemicals earnings increased by $190 million versus the second quarter of 2007. Improved margins benefited earning by $110 million, while volume mix effects were negative $35 million. Other impacts increased earnings by $115 million, including positive tax effects.   \\n\\nTurning now to our corporate and financing segment. The corporation recorded third-quarter expenses of $92 million in the corporate and financing segment, unchanged from the third quarter of 2006. The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 46%.   \\n\\nThe corporation distributed almost $9 billion to shareholders in the third quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. During the quarter, ExxonMobile purchased $7 billion in shares in excess of dilution, reducing the number of shares outstanding by 1.5% and further demonstrating our ongoing commitment to return cash to our shareholders.   \\n\\nCapEx in the third quarter was $5.4 billion, an increase of 7.5% from the third quarter of 2006. At the end of the third quarter, our cash balance was $36 billion, and debt was $9 billion.   \\n\\nIn summary, these results highlight the fundamental strength of our business, our ability to deliver superior operational performance, and continue to grow our integrated capabilities while continuing to position ourself for future demand growth and create value for our shareholders.   \\n\\nThat concludes my prepared remarks, and I would now be happy to take your questions.   \\n\\nOPERATOR: Thank you, Mr. Hubble.   \\n\\nThe question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. If you would like to ask a question, please do so by pressing the star key followed by the digit one on your touch-tone telephone. We request that you limit your number of questions to two so that as many may have the opportunity to -- excuse me -- may have the opportunity to participate as possible. If you are using a speaker phone, please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. We will proceed in the order that you signal us and will take as many questions as time permits. Once again, press star-one on your touch-tone telephone to ask a question. If you find your questions have been answered, you may remove yourself by pressing the star key followed by the digit two.   \\n\\nWe'll take our first question from Dan Barcelo from Banc of America. Go ahead.   \\n\\nDAN BARCELO, ANALYST, BANC OF AMERICA SECURITIES: Yes, good morning, Henry. Regarding one of your comments about the redistribution of cash to shareholders, you mentioned the $7 billion rate in the third quarter. Are you able to provide any color into the fourth quarter and into '08 at this point? And --   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Well --   \\n\\nDAN BARCELO: The second question, I will lay them out now, was on the production side. Could you just run through -- you gave good detail in the entitlement effects. Could you just reiterate the effects -- in particular I'm looking at oil in West Africa just for this quarter. What was that impact specifically for there? Thanks.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Yes. Well, as you know, unless we're making a change we don't provide forward guidance on our repurchases. We've been at the $7 billion here last quarter, and for the -- for about the last year.   \\n\\nOn the other question, on the volume side and the specific entitlement effects associated in Africa, you see the African volumes were down basically due to entitlement effects. The new project volumes there have been performing well and they've more than offset natural field decline. That's real what he you're seeing.   \\n\\nAnd that's really, you know, as you look at the entitlement effects, as you know, some of that production comes from production sharing contracts. And in some of the PSC's, the net entitlement is reduced when cumulative production or profitability thresholds are reached. And, you know, as you think about this, the impacts are larger with the strong crude prices that we've seen. But frankly, when you step back from it, I mean, the earnings are better and the overall financial performance of these projects are better with the higher prices. All of the projects in the area are performing well, and so that really is the impact of this entitlement effect.   \\n\\nDAN BARCELO: Okay. Thank you.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Yeah.   \\n\\nOPERATOR: We'll take our next question from Doug Terreson from  Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.   \\n\\nDOUG TERRESON, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Good morning, Henry.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Hi, Doug.   \\n\\nDOUG TERRESON: I want to ask an entitlement question, too.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Alright.   \\n\\nDOUG TERRESON: And this is really kind of a clarification. When you said -- at least I think you said that production rose about 3% before considering entitlement effects, were you referring to the global base of production rather than specific geographical region, or did you even say that? Could you kind of --   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: That was a global comment.   \\n\\nDOUG TERRESON: Okay.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: If you look at -- if you look at, you know, on an OEB basis, we were down 2% on the, you know, this year versus last year third quarter.   \\n\\nDOUG TERRESON: Right.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: About 1% of that effect was associated with Venezuela.   \\n\\nDOUG TERRESON: Okay.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: And then there is -- there's about 3.5% that are associated with entitlements, and then you also have some the smaller effects in quotas and divestments. When you take those effects out, that's the 3%, and when you look at -- basically that's coming from the projects and projects that are coming on faster than -- than rates of decline. So that's -- that's what you see there.   \\n\\nDOUG TERRESON: Okay. And -- and while we're on the subject of Africa, could you provide an update on the profile in Chad, investment profile in Chad and any update that you might have there.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: I -- I don't have anything specific on Chad. There's, you know -- we're continuing, we're continuing with our project. Our -- our second -- our 2007 drilling program is basically complete at this point.   \\n\\nDOUG TERRESON: Okay.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: But nothing really specific to highlight there.   \\n\\nDOUG TERRESON: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Okay.   \\n\\nOPERATOR: We will take our next question from Nikki Decker from  Bear Stearns. Go ahead.   \\n\\nNIKKI DECKER, ANALYST, BEAR STEARNS: Good morning, Henry.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Hi, Nikki.   \\n\\nNIKKI DECKER: Getting back to the Africa volumes --   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Yes?   \\n\\nNIKKI DECKER: You know, taking entitlement effects into account, is it reasonable to expect, though, from this phase that Africa volumes might rise due to new production on block 15 and 17 in Angola and also in Nigeria?   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Well, I mean, as we bring on new projects, they do, of course, add to that capacity. But as you go forward and that's really the effect that we're seeing here is that -- at these higher prices, the prices that we're seeing today, you know, I don't know what those future effects are going to be. And, you know, what happens is you -- as you have these higher prices, of course you're recovering your costs faster, you're recovering -- you have more profit barrels to share, but you're doing that with less barrels. And so overall, we're very pleased with the projects and they're performing very well. But you do see less volumes associated with them. Our focus is, though, on the returns associated with those projects. Of course, it means better performance, not just for us but for the host governments, as well. And we've got a good slate of projects and a good pipeline of projects coming along. So we feel confident about the future, but that's the impact that we're seeing in the quarter.   \\n\\nNIKKI DECKER: Okay. Thanks.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Yep.   \\n\\nNIKKI DECKER: And for my second question, I'd like to switch to the downstream. Are there -- your competitors have been talking about the difficulty in capturing margins relative to proxies. Your downstream results were somewhat consistent with the industry. Maybe if you could, Henry, quantify the benefit of your feedstock flexibility and perhaps comment on year-over-year marketing results.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Yeah. I mean, if you look at the margin impacts that we had in the quarter, we're down over $600 billion off of, you know, what were very strong third-quarter '06 performance. The bulk of that is in refining, I guess if you look at that it's about 2/3 or a little better, and then the balance was in marketing.   \\n\\nYou know, if I think about our overall capability in this area, though, we have strong margins capture, the programs that we have with -- in particular the molecule management technology that we have to help capture our -- the investments that we've made over many years in high conversion refining capacity allow us to continue to take advantage of the high clean/dirty spreads that are out there and the process, crude processing flexibility that we have. So we're constantly going after new crudes that's are either advantaged for our processing capabilities, and the molecule management technology, both from a planning standpoint as well as real-time operations, that really help us manage on a molecular basis how to maximize profitability in the refining units as well as our chemical plants, when we have those integrated facilities, it's really, we think, a unique advantage in the industry.   \\n\\nNIKKI DECKER: Okay. That's great. Thanks, Henry.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Thanks.   \\n\\nOPERATOR: We will take our next question from Doug Leggate with  Citigroup. Please go ahead.   \\n\\nDOUG LEGGATE, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: Thank you, good morning Henry.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Hi Doug.   \\n\\nDOUG LEGGATE: I'm going to flog this Africa horse a little bit more I'm afraid. When we look at the actual volumes, obviously we're down about 120,000 barrels per day year over year, a little less than that. Oil prices on average are only up $5. Have we -- have we moved out of cost recovery in any significant way year over year in that region?   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Yeah. You know, I mean, as you know, they're made up of individual -- both components, cost recovery as well as, you know, profit sharing. And -- and you have a number -- we have -- because we have a number of different projects, they all have different arrangements, have different points of recovery, you know, that effect is going on, and you also have -- you also have just the impacts from the higher prices. So -- so yes, there are impacts that are associated with these entitlements and cost recovery is a piece of that.   \\n\\nDOUG LEGGATE: So --   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Again, you know, again I think the real key here, though, is there's no question that these projects are performing better than -- than certainly when we approved them, better for us and better for the host governments because of the, one, the projects are performing well, they were delivered at lower cost than we originally anticipated, they came in on schedule, and they basically have been performing well, but one of the consequences of higher prices is there are less barrels.   \\n\\nDOUG LEGGATE: I guess I'll follow on related to that. So if oil prices stayed let's assume at the Q3 average levels, x new projects coming on, we would expect these volumes to remain at that kind of level in Africa?   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: I mean, you're going to have -- you're going to have continuing impacts, but I'm not going to get into forward projection on what that will be. You know, we'll go through and give an update that -- at our analysts meeting, and that will reflect, you know, another year of higher prices and the impacts associated with that in the projection that we have going forward.   \\n\\nDOUG LEGGATE: Okay. I guess, a final one from me. And this classifies as my second question. If we look at your capture in the upstream, you always show this chart of realized prices versus your net income per barrel. It did appear to move off the line quite a bit this time, suggesting that something else is going on. You mentioned higher expenses in your -- in the press release.   \\n\\nCan you maybe just try and quantify if it was that or maybe the lack of property sales, if that was a meaningful issue this quarter. That would help us understand a little bit why that capture rate appears to have deteriorated this quarter.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Yeah. If you -- if you look at the other earnings effects and that's really what can impact that or it also contributes to it. I mean, there were -- the biggest single factor is higher expenses. So it was over half of the total, a lot of that higher, you know, is -- it's both cash and non-cash, but a big piece associated with non-cash costs, associated with the new projects that we start up, so you're seeing higher depreciations associated with those. In terms of the balance, you know, we did see some positive earnings impacts from asset sales in 2006 that were higher than what we had in this quarter. So the absence of those on a relative basis caused some of that decline, and we also had some -- some negative forex effects in there, there's about $80 million associated with that.   \\n\\nSo those -- those were the big factors. But again, you know, as you point out, I mean, if you look at the absolute level of net income per barrel, it's strong. And I think that really is the best reflection of the overall performance of the portfolio.   \\n\\nWhen you think about all of the things that go into the quality of the projects, the -- the quality of the project management, the performance of those projects, the cost control, all of that basically ends up being reflected in that very strong net income-per-barrel number that we have in the industry.   \\n\\nDOUG LEGGATE: Great. Thanks a lot, Henry.   \\n\\nOPERATOR: We will take our next question from Neil McMahon from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.   \\n\\nNEIL MCMAHON, ANALYST, SANFORD BERNSTEIN: Good morning, guys.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Hi, Neil.   \\n\\nNEIL MCMAHON: Just two questions as you allow. The first question really just an update on your Wildcat exploration that's been going on this year. Maybe first on the Columbia well you're drilling in the Caribbean, and secondly, anything further on the Orphan Basin offshore, north of Newfoundland.   \\n\\nAnd then for the second question, if you look at your US oil and liquids production, year over year it hasn't gone down very much at all. And I'm wondering if that's due to a reduction in any land sales there, or are you actually doing something more dramatic in terms of investing onshore US?   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: All right. Let me just first hit the -- in Colombia, the Tayrona block, we're drilling our first well, the Araza1. And really I'd want to refer any other questions to  Petrobras, who's the operator of that.   \\n\\nThe other piece I guess was associated with Orphan. I mean, we're still -- we're still progressing the technical work. We're looking to drill the -- the next well next year. We have -- we have drilled the Great Barasway well there, and we'll just -- we're evaluating that data, and we'll decide what the next prospect will be. Then, you know, if you look at the volumes associated with the US on the year-on-year, basically, you know, it's -- it's, you know, the net impact there is -- has been essentially improved reliability, a piece of that, no big story. Some of that was in -- associated with the Alaska operations, as you may recall. But basically, you know, we -- we have a good continuing work program there, and that's the net effect of it all.   \\n\\nNEIL MCMAHON: Okay. So it's mainly an Alaska effect, coming back up --   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: That's -- that's a piece of it, yeah.   \\n\\nNEIL MCMAHON: Okay.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Yeah.   \\n\\nOPERATOR: We will take our next question from Michael LaMotte with  JP Morgan. Please go ahead.   \\n\\nMICHAEL LAMOTTE, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: Thanks. Good morning, Henry.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Hi.   \\n\\nMICHAEL LAMOTTE: I was hoping you could shed a little light on heavy oil and EOR opportunities in the Middle East, in particular the chatter about your involvement in -- in Kuwait on the heavy oil side.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Yes. You know, we're -- I can't say a lot there. We're -- you know, they have a number of heavy oil prospects in Kuwait. There are studies going on. We're very interested in participating in that. We're participating in -- in studies there at this point. But I really, you know, if you have -- if you're looking for more specifics on that, I think KOC is probably the right people to talk to on that one.   \\n\\nMICHAEL LAMOTTE: Okay. Maybe I can ask the question a little differently then. If I understand the talk around them at this point, there are TSA agreements that would not allow an operator to actually book reserves. In the past you've tended to shy away from that kind of contract. I'm curious as to, you know, maybe sort of the change in the strategic thinking.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: There is nothing -- this is -- I have no comment on that. You know, the -- the studies are still underway. There's no -- there have been no decisions made. It's way premature to decide how this is going to be worked. So I just really can't add anything to that. Again, if you want to get some specifics on how KOC's thinking about it, I think that's the right place to start.   \\n\\nMICHAEL LAMOTTE: Okay. Okay. And then second question, getting back to this entitlement issue, I know it's early coming into year end, but any thought on impact on reserves associated with entitlement changes?   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Well, the -- we'll go through and update that again with our -- you know early or first-quarter release on that. So I really -- I can't give you anything at this point. You know, those -- all of the impacts will be reflected in those outlooks.   \\n\\nMICHAEL LAMOTTE: Okay. Thanks, Henry.   \\n\\nOPERATOR: We will take our next question from John Herrlin with  Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Hi, John. How you doing?   \\n\\nJOHN HERRLIN, ANALYST, MERRILL LYNCH: Good. In Europe, your gas sales were kind of low and you mentioned earlier that it was seasonal, and also asset sales. Was it mainly seasonal? Can you give us kind of a split?   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Yeah. In Europe the biggest piece was associated with, you know,if you look at the sequential piece, the combined effect was the -- you know, the effect of some net-based client. The higher maintenance divestments were -- were, you know, the next biggest piece, and then there was lower seasonal demand. So if you look at the demand piece, it's about 50 of that.   \\n\\nJOHN HERRLIN: Okay. Taking that to oil since those volumes were down a bunch, too. Is that also maintenance related or decline?   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Well, if you look at -- if you're looking year-on-year or sequentially?   \\n\\nJOHN HERRLIN: Sequentially in Europe, yeah.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Yeah, okay. We'll look at that. Yeah. It's -- it's basically the bulk of it is field decline there in the period. And you have -- and you have some -- that's a big effect.   \\n\\nJOHN HERRLIN: Okay.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: It's mature area, and that's -- that's the effect you're seeing.   \\n\\nJOHN HERRLIN: Okay. That's fine. Yeah. Getting back to Kuwait, I'll try the question a different way or a different question I guess.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Okay.   \\n\\nJOHN HERRLIN: You've had success obviously with Upper Zakum. I'm not familiar with the geology of what you're looking at. Are these carbonates?   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: I -- you know, they're -- they're heavy oil deposits. I'm not familiar with the specifics of the field there.   \\n\\nJOHN HERRLIN: Okay. And then revisiting West Africa again, could you -- you probably won't want to do this, but could you perhaps break down the entitlement effects by, you know, EG, Angola, Nigeria, or not possible?   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: I'm not -- you know, I don't think it's appropriate to break those down.   \\n\\nJOHN HERRLIN: Okay. All right. That's fine. Thank you, appreciate it.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: All right.   \\n\\nOPERATOR: We will take our next question from Paul Chang with  Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead.   \\n\\nPAUL CHANG, ANALYST, LEHMAN BROTHERS: Hey, Henry, good morning.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Yes, hi, Paul.   \\n\\nPAUL CHANG: I have to apologize first because I come in late so you may have already covered them in your prepared remarks. Did you break down what is the effects of tax on inventory or asset sales gain or loss on those items in the third quarter versus the second quarter?   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Yeah. No, I haven't. But the -- the forex impacts, you know, if you look at the net impact for the third quarter, they were pretty small. You know, it's like $14 million something in the range, quite small. But there is -- there -- we're naturally hedged. And we see some negative impacts in the upstream. We see positive impacts in downstream and chemicals that basically offset that.   \\n\\nPAUL CHANG: Right. Can you break down by division then for us?   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Upstream is about -- as I mentioned about 80, negative. And then -- and the bulk of the offsetting was in chemicals.   \\n\\nPAUL CHANG: Right. I'm talking about sequentially from the second quarter level. If the 80 is still a good number --   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Yeah, that's pretty close. You know, and the same -- the net effect for total there when you look at it sequentially, there was less offset, not much offset from the downstream in chemicals part of the business. So that kind of carried through to the bottom line.   \\n\\nPAUL CHANG: So it was about $80 million sequential?   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: That's correct. That's correct. In total.   \\n\\nPAUL CHANG: In total.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Right.   \\n\\nPAUL CHANG: How about any tax adjustment for inventory gain or loss?   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: No. We're on a LIFO basis and we don't take any -- have any inventory effects during --   \\n\\nPAUL CHANG: How about the price finalization?   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Price finalization, you know, if you look on an absolute basis, we had about $50 million on a -- now, again, talking sequential?   \\n\\nPAUL CHANG: Yes.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Yeah. So about $50 million in the US on an absolute basis, $65 million total. Then if you look at the delta, you know, it was like $30 million in total.   \\n\\nPAUL CHANG: I assume that that is a positive, right?   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Excuse me. I'm sorry. In the third quarter of '07, the absolute level is all negative, so it's about $65 million negative. If you look at the change, it was positive relative to -- to the prior -- to the second quarter, but quite small.   \\n\\nPAUL CHANG: Right. And you indicated that one of the reasons about your -- perhaps a little bit lower unit profitability in terms of the capture rate comparing to the third quarter of last year is that you have a lesser after-sales gain. So how big is the after-sales gain on the absolute level?   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: You know, it's -- I don't have -- I don't have a breakdown on it. The two big factors -- we had in the absence of sales was associated with the Carson Creek and Canada, and then we had some sales in -- in France last year that -- that were -- but I don't have a total for you there. Those were the two that were -- kind of the absence of those two, and basically mature areas.   \\n\\nPAUL CHANG: Oh, so I understand about last year-- I'm talking about in this year, third quarter -- (inaudible)   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Right. In this third quarter we didn't have a whole lot in there that was -- a little bit that we had in the South North Sea sale, associated with gas, and that was it.   \\n\\nPAUL CHANG: Okay. And the second question would be the Pyon Basin --   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Paul, maybe you ought to come back at the end. I that's more than two.   \\n\\nPAUL CHANG: Okay, will do.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Thanks.   \\n\\nOPERATOR: As a reminder, if you would to ask a question, press star-one on your touch-tone telephone. The next question is from Mark Gilman from the Benchmark Company. Please go ahead.   \\n\\nMARK GILMAN, ANALYST, BENCHMARK COMPANY: Hi Henry, good morning.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Hi Mark, how are you?   \\n\\nMARK GILMAN: Good, thanks you,. ad hopefully you are as well. I wanted to ask about Marimba and the Statfjord Late Life project. My assumption on these projects, Henry, is that we will not see volumes actually rising as a result of these projects, but rather in both cases they represent the ability to forego what would otherwise be declines. Marimba vis-a-vis Kizomba A and Statfjord obviously being the facilities and fields currently in production. Is that an accurate assumption in both cases?   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Pretty much. You know, there's -- there's the -- you know, you're basically trying to maintain the capacity full utilization of the facilities that you have there. And so that's what you see from those developments for the most part.   \\n\\nMARK GILMAN: Okay. And one other one if I could, just one more whack at this entitlement issue from a different angle.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Yes.   \\n\\nMARK GILMAN: Henry, there are basically two kinds of entitlement issues that impact on reported production. One is the just the simple and rather straight-forward cost recovery issue. The other is a more permanent, in terms of life of field, change in splits associated either with cumulative return or cumulative production thresholds and/or cost recovery factors. I'm assuming that where what we're dealing with here is primarily the latter. And is, therefore, not something that in a different price environment is likely to change as we go forward. Is that assumption accurate?   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Well, I'm not going to break out the split for you here. You know, you have both effects, and -- but they are -- they're both in a continuing basis-- and again, it's going to depend on how crude prices evolve from here.   \\n\\nMARK GILMAN: Okay. Thank you, Henry.   \\n\\nOPERATOR: We will take our next question from Paul Sankey from  Deutsche Bank. Go ahead.   \\n\\nPAUL SANKEY, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: Hi, Henry.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Hi Paul. I had a three-part Middle East question, but I'm not going to go there on Q&A. Okay.   \\n\\nPAUL SANKEY: Let's move on to Upper Zakum. You've got pretty significant downtime believe there right now. Could just quantify how long that's going to be out for and what sort of impact that will have on Q4, thanks.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Yeah. I don't have anything right at the tip of my fingers. Let's see if I can get you something on -- on that because I really don't have any specific data on that at this point.   \\n\\nPAUL SANKEY: But your turnaround there?   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: You probably ought to ask ZADCO on that.   \\n\\nPAUL SANKEY: Okay. I'll leave it on that one then, obviously. On the second part, was about startups in Qatar next year. Can you just update us on when you expect those two major projects to be delivering?   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Yeah. As we had laid out in our earlier plans, we're expecting those, you know, the startup of the Qatargas II Train 4 in 2008, and the RasGas Train 6 also scheduled for startup in 2008, expecting one about mid-year and the other closer to the end of the year. At the end of the year. It's the same as the F&O.   \\n\\nPAUL SANKEY: Okay. That's -- that answers that one. Given -- we had a couple of slightly nonanswer there, I'll throw in one final one. Could you quantify the extent to which disposals impacted your downstream numbers? It's notable particularly in Europe, but also to an extent in Asia, huh lower throughputs and sales in both those regions. Thanks.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Yeah. The -- the big impact in Europe is Inglestadt, and both on a on the year-on-year comparisons that you have there. And then, you know, there's ongoing on the product sales. We have ongoing high grading that we've got going on pretty much around the world. A big piece of that happened in Africa, some of South America, but there's also high grading that's going on in the other portfolios, as well. And then of course then you also have impacts associated with turnarounds that are also impacting some of the numbers.   \\n\\nPAUL SANKEY: Any barrel numbers you can give me on this?   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: If you look at -- let me just look and see if I've got something here. You know, if you look at the totals for the downstream, we're down on the petroleum product sales, as you know, about 1%, and that basically, you know, if you look at that -- let me see what I've got here. Yeah. Let's see, you've got -- well, I don't have a breakdown by, you know -- basically US, if you look on a third-quarter '06 versus third-quarter '07 throughputwise, of course we were up, and basically that's improved reliability and that was almost all that. Then if you look at the other -- the turnaround impact in Asia-Pacific, that was Singapore and Japan,the total of that was about the level that you see, the $116 million that's in the numbers. So it's -- those were the two impacts there.   \\n\\nPAUL SANKEY: That's on the throughputs, then we take Inglestadt out of the Europe number?   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: That's right. That's right.   \\n\\nPAUL SANKEY: Okay, any help you can give me on the product sales?   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: And on the product sales, that, again, is -- as I was talking about the divestment, that's -- you know, the big piece of -- I'm just trying to look at if we have anything that splits it. It's basically divestments, the bulk of it is divestments in each of these areas. The same story. And you know, you kind of see it reflected in the numbers in the US, basically down the same direction, and the overall total sales down about the same direction from -- from the throughputs. About down equally.   \\n\\nPAUL SANKEY: So the underlying market was flat is what you're telling me?   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Yeah. If you go back to -- if you're trying to get back to what was the product demand, you know, what we're seeing on a worldwide basis is that we're, you know, we continue to see growth overall, not much down at all from what we have historically seen on a total -- on total global demand basis. Most of that growth is occurring in the Asia PAC area. US is near flat, up a little bit, and, you know, we're seeing -- so there's nothing there that we can really point to as a global demand response. Again, you don't know how high it would be if crude prices weren't this high. But we're not seeing big declines or any -- you know, we're still seeing year-on-year growth and not seeing declines in that rate of growth on a worldwide basis.   \\n\\nPAUL SANKEY: Sounds like you're predicting $100 oil then, Henry.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: I don't know. I can't -- I can't tell you why it's at $90-something today.   \\n\\nPAUL SANKEY: Okay. Thanks.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: All right.   \\n\\nOPERATOR: We will take our next question from Mark Flannery with  Credit Suisse . Please go   \\n\\nMARK FLANNERY, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE: Hi, Henry.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Hi.   \\n\\nMARK FLANNERY: I have more of a local question about ethanol blending in the US.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Yes?   \\n\\nMARK FLANNERY: Specifically in the southeast, are you guys getting ready to blend more ethanol into product in the southeast? I'm thinking Florida particularly, from next year, and are you making the necessary infrastructure and terminal investments right now or are you holding back a little bit?   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Well, as you know, we're a major blender of ethanol. There are incentives to blend ethanol currently, we're maximizing that. But I'm not going to get into the specific regional investment thoughts that we might have.   \\n\\nBut we're basically meeting the federal requirements, and obviously we've -- you know, we've blended before it was required because we saw economic opportunities there. And -- and we continued to do that. So we'll -- we'll take advantage of the incentives that are there to blend ethanol. But I -- again, not going to get into specific investment plans.   \\n\\nMARK FLANNERY: Right. Just a quick follow-up on the refining side. When you think about ethanol blending and how it might go in this country, just for the sake of it, say, the donation goes to E10 at some unspecified time in the future, does that impact the way you think about investments in the domestic refining base?   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Well, you know, as we look at, you know, if you look at our long-term outlook for demand in the US and actually in OECD in general, our longer term outlook is basically that it's flat. And what you see there is ongoing efficiencies that continue to come in, basically offsetting whatever modest growth there may be in miles driven and vehicle use.   \\n\\nSo as we go forward, we're not seeing a lot of growth in our outlook, so we can continue to focus on economically creeping our capacities, debottlenecking, low-cost conversion ads. That's been part of our base improvement, continuous improvement of our refining facilities. So we're constantly adding capacity through those kind of mechanisms, but we're not seeing a lot of need for grassroots kinds of investment in these mature markets.   \\n\\nNow in contrast, though, when you move out to Asia-Pacific, China, some of these other areas, you know, and our Fujian province a prime example there where we're investing to meet that growing demand which is substantially what you can meet through the bottlenecking. And of course, you know, in the base we're running our conversion capacity full in all of the regions, and there is incentive to continue to debottleneck that.   \\n\\nMARK FLANNERY: Right. Thank you very much.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Yep.   \\n\\nOPERATOR: We will take a follow-up question from Mark Gilman with the Benchmark Company. Please go ahead.   \\n\\nMARK GILMAN: Henry, I noticed that the volume mix bar in your upstream year-over-year earnings variance is essentially zero.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Yeah.   \\n\\nMARK GILMAN: The fact that the production is down.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Yes.   \\n\\nMARK GILMAN: Was the lifting position in this recently completed quarter more favorable than production, and that explains the bar in the chart? Or was there an adverse lifting position in the year-ago period? Can you shed some light on that.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Basically it's -- what you're seeing there is a mix effect, as you point out, there is a positive effect associated with the Sakhalin project where we have the export facilities now. So you have higher realizations associated with that.   \\n\\nMARK GILMAN: Okay. And one other one if I could. Marimba, offshore Angola. Is that ringed fence with Kiz A in the same PSC, or is it a separate PSC?   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: It's ring fenced.   \\n\\nMARK GILMAN: Thank you.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Yep.   \\n\\nOPERATOR: We will take a follow-up question from Paul Chang with  Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead.   \\n\\nPAUL CHANG: Henry --   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Hey, Paul.   \\n\\nPAUL CHANG: Nigeria, did the government ever contact you guys about changes in the region or just noise --   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: No, we have not had any contacts there at this point.   \\n\\nPAUL CHANG: I see. A final one. The Pyon Basin, where are you in terms of production at this point and what kind of rig program that you have.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: It's -- the latest numbers I have, about 50 million cubic feet per day, and of course we have -- we have, our phase one project that we're working for. We've gotten the finding of no significant impact associated with that, so we're basically moving ahead with our development plans there. And expecting that -- that's out in our '08-'09 timeframe basically.   \\n\\nPAUL CHANG: Are we still looking at 400 million cubic feet for Qatar production by the 2010-2011, even under the to-date gas price?   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Well, when you look at the total, you know, we have -- we have multiple phases that gets out -- it's in the '06 F and O. But basically those future phases take us out to 2011 or so, something in that, beyond. Basically get us up to that full potential.   \\n\\nPAUL CHANG: So the current price structure in the natural gas did not alter your view or your program.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Well, there's infrastructure that's being added there to get the gas out of the region. So that -- that's some of -- that's a short-term phenomenon that you're seeing now.   \\n\\nPAUL CHANG: Okay. We're good. Thank you.   \\n\\nOPERATOR: This will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Hubble, I will turn the conference back over to you for closing comments.   \\n\\nHENRY HUBBLE: Well, I just want to say thanks to everybody for your questions and for listening in. And look forward to seeing you on the road. Bye.   \\n\\nOPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen this will conclude  ExxonMobil's third quarter conference call.

              "'I\\'m Rex Tillerson, I\\'m the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Exxon Mobil Corporation. And I am pleased to welcome each of you that made the effort to join us today in person. I also, though, want to welcome our shareholders around the world who are joining us by way of the Internet.\\n\\nI do hope you had the opportunity to meet some of our employees in person while visiting the displays in the foyer this morning. These Exxon Mobil employees are among the over 73,000 people who are working 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year on your behalf. And many of them are working in challenging locations to deliver the energy and products needed by consumers around the world.\\n\\nThe financial and operating results that I bring to you today are really their results, and I have the privilege of presenting them to you on their behalf.\\n\\nSeated next to me is Jeff Woodbury, Vice President of Investor Relations and our Corporate Secretary. He will assist me in running the meeting today. I\\'ll introduce the other members of the board to you a little later in the meeting.\\n\\nAs mentioned on Page 2 of the proxy statement, it is the policy of the corporation to provide confidential voting to shareholders. For shareholders who returned their proxy cards without written comments, the voted proxies have not been seen by nor reported to the corporation except in aggregate numbers. Anyone turning in a proxy card at this meeting who wishes to keep his or her votes secret, may obtain an envelope from the ushers. Proxy cards will be collected later in the meeting. A list of shareholders entitled to vote at this meeting or at any adjournment thereof is available for inspection. If anyone wishes to examine this list, an usher will be pleased to direct you to the proper location.\\n\\nShirley Nessralla and Paula Buckley of Computershare Trust Company have been appointed Inspectors of the Election for this meeting. They have taken an oath of office that has been delivered to the Secretary for filing with the minutes of the meeting. Notice of this meeting has been properly given, and the Inspectors of Election have determined that a quorum is present. There are 3.5 billion shares represented at this meeting, equating to approximately 85% of the issued and outstanding shares of stock of the corporation that are entitled to vote. I directed the inspector\\'s written determination as to the number of shares entitled to vote at the meeting be filed with the minutes. I declare a quorum present and the meeting ready for business.\\n\\nI\\'d now like to explain our plan for conducting the meeting today. First, Secretary Woodbury will outline the rules of conduct and how to gain recognition. Then, I\\'ll make some brief comments about our business results and the future we see for your company. After that, the items of business comprised of 14 proposals from the Board of Directors and shareholders will be presented. As described in the Annual Meeting program, discussion on the items of business will be deferred until all items have been presented. Time permitting, we may also have time to respond to some of the questions submitted ahead of time via proxy cards and the Internet. Upon completion of the discussion on the items of business and voting, the polls will be closed, the formal business of this year\\'s Annual Meeting will be concluded, and the Inspectors of Election will prepare this preliminary voting report.\\n\\nWhile this is occurring, there may be time for additional comments or questions regarding our business. When the inspectors are ready, I\\'ll ask them to give us their voting report. We will then conclude the meeting.\\n\\nShown in this slide is the list of board and shareholder proposals that will be presented and voted on this morning. The 14 items of business will be presented beginning with the election of directors, the ratification of independent auditors and the advisory vote to approve executive compensation as required by law. Then, we will continue with the 11 shareholder proposals shown in the proxy statement.\\n\\nAt this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Jeff Woodbury to discuss the rules of conduct.\\n\\nJEFF WOODBURY, VP OF INVESTOR RELATIONS, CORPORATE SECRETARY, EXXONMOBIL CORPORATION: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. I\\'d like to take this opportunity to familiarize everyone with the safety features of the auditorium. In case of emergency, we will be notified through the public address system. Emergency exits for the ground level, as shown on the screen behind me, are situated at the rear of the auditorium, where you entered, and down in front on either side. If we do need to evacuate, please proceed to the nearest exit and the Meyerson personnel will guide you to the best way out. In addition, for safety reasons, please do not stand in aisles or in the back of the hall and do not block the exits.\\n\\nTo ensure that the meeting is conducted in the interest of all shareholders, there are certain rules of conduct governing this meeting. These rules are included in the program and shown on the screen behind me.\\n\\nLet me now just cover several of the rules. The distribution of pamphlets and other literature, banners, signs and other displays is strictly prohibited. Anyone who intentionally obstructs or interferes with this lawful meeting by physical action or verbal utterance is in violation of Texas law. Any persons engaging in such conduct will be asked to cease, and if they refuse, they will be escorted from the meeting.\\n\\nThe laws of New Jersey, where Exxon Mobil is incorporated, provide that no business can be brought up for a vote unless proper notice has been given to all shareholders. Therefore, in the fairness of other shareholders not in attendance and in keeping with the laws that govern our Annual Meeting, formal business at today\\'s meeting is restricted to the items included in this year\\'s proxy statement. As such, additional proposals may not be introduced on the floor.\\n\\nIn order to present a proposal, you must have checked in at the admission\\'s desk in the lobby and verified that you are the proponent or a duly authorized proxy under New Jersey law. Presenters whose credentials have been verified will be given a blue presenter\\'s pass. If neither the proponent nor an authorized proxy has checked in and obtained a presenter\\'s pass, we will presume the proponent is not present, and I will move the proposal for the purposes of orderly conduct of the meeting and so that shareholder votes cast may be recorded. However, I will not be acting as a representative of the proponent. The authorized presenter of a shareholder proposal will have up to 3 minutes to present the proposal, and time may not be shared with another speaker. As the Chairman indicated, discussion on all items of business will be deferred until the discussion period later in the meeting.\\n\\nOnly shareholders as of record date or their properly appointed proxies are entitled to speak at this Annual Meeting of Exxon Mobil shareholders. Shareholders making comments during the meeting must speak or have the words translated into English so that the majority of shareholders present can understand what is being said. Comments that are offensive or otherwise inappropriate will not be permitted. Also, we ask that any issues of personal interest that\\'s not relevant to all shareholders be raised directly with appropriate company representatives outside of the Annual Meeting. We request that individual shareholders respect the right of others to speak and keep their comments as brief as possible. As noted in the proxy statement, the Chairman has broad authority to conduct the meeting in an orderly and timely manner.\\n\\nIf you wish to make comments, you must first fill out a speaker identification card that is included in the program and was provided to you as you entered the lobby. This card confirms that you meet the requirements to speak at this meeting. Please give the completed card to the usher when you are recognized to address the meeting.\\n\\nTo ensure as many shareholders as possible who want to address the meeting today have the opportunity to do so, we ask you to follow these additional instructions. If you would like to address the meeting, move to a reserved aisle seat, remain seated, raise your hand holding your speaker identification card to indicate to the Chairman that you wish to speak. When recognized by the Chairman, give your completed speaker card to the usher, and a microphone will be provided. Please stand and begin by stating your name. You may speak for up to 2 minutes.\\n\\nNow due to the large number of items on today\\'s agenda and a need to conclude the meeting within a reasonable period of time, we cannot assure that every shareholder who wishes to speak will be able to do so. First priority will be given to those who have not yet had an opportunity to speak.\\n\\nAs we\\'ve done in the past, we\\'ve provided a timing system with lights that will help speakers manage their time, and we\\'ll demonstrate the system at this time.\\n\\nWhen the Chairman recognizes a speaker and a microphone has been provided by the usher, a green light will come on at the displays on both sides of the stage. The hall microphones will be activated only after the speaker has been recognized by the Chairman. When the speaker\\'s time remaining reaches 30 seconds, a yellow light will turn on, and finally, a red light will indicate the speaker is at the end of their allowed time. And at that point, we ask you to conclude your comments.\\n\\nFinally, as we typically note at the outset of similar meetings, I would like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement that\\'s shown on this slide. The statement contains information regarding today\\'s presentation and discussion. You may also refer to the corporate website for additional information on factors affecting future results as well as supplementary information defining key terms that we use today throughout the meeting.\\n\\nAnd now I will turn the podium back to the Chairman to provide an overview on the business. Thank you.\\n\\nREX TILLERSON: Thank you, Jeff. We will address our items of business shortly. However, first, I will share with you some financial and operating highlights from 2015, provide an update on our annual outlook for energy and review key elements of our integrated businesses. The photo you see behind me is the Antwerp refinery, one of the most efficient in Europe, where we are progressing construction of a new delayed coker. Exxon Mobil\\'s strategy, constancy of purpose and competitive advantages continue to create superior, long-term shareholder value. Regardless of the business environment, we maintain a relentless focus on the fundamentals, those factors that we control. Our integrated business model remains resilient through the commodity price cycle. We are continuing a disciplined and paced investment approach focused on creating value while maintaining our commitment to a reliable and growing dividend.\\n\\nExxon Mobil is demonstrating differentiated performance that has become all the more visible this past year. We lead the industry in return on capital employed and most importantly, long-term shareholder returns.\\n\\nOver the next few slides, I\\'ll highlight how we have delivered on our 2015 commitments and discuss our industry-leading performance against several key metrics. This photograph of the Deepwater Champion drilling vessel, which successfully drilled the Liza-1 exploration discovery well offshore Guyana, highlights one example of our approach to long-term resource capture and value generation. We\\'re pleased with the initial results, and I\\'ll discuss our plans for Guyana later in the presentation.\\n\\nSince our shareholder meeting last year, the business environment continued to deteriorate with a sharp decrease in crude oil and natural gas prices. The graphic is a stark reminder of the volatile and cyclical nature of a commodity prices business. However, the corporation is uniquely suited to endure these conditions and outperform the competition.\\n\\nRegardless of prices, we remain focused on the following business fundamentals. Operational integrity is an organizational imperative. Operating safely, reliably and effectively is the primary objective. Maximizing the reliability of our facilities, lowering cost and increasing efficiency maximizes the value of our existing asset base.\\n\\nOur integrated businesses have a distinct competitive advantage which enables us to create additional value as market conditions change. Our investment decisions are based on a long-term view informed by our energy outlook and tested across various economic parameters, including a broad range of commodity prices.\\n\\nFinally, once we decide to invest, our world-class project execution delivers a competitive, reliable asset base. These fundamentals, applied daily throughout our portfolio, deliver leading results that grow shareholder value throughout the business cycle.\\n\\n2015 results demonstrate the strength of our integrated business in a weaker commodity price environment. Our approach to business, operations and corporate citizenship is grounded in a commitment to integrity in everything we do. Nowhere is that more evident than in our commitment to safe operations. As the chart shows, our workforce safety performance for both employees and our contractors remains strong relative to the industry.\\n\\nAs to financial results, total corporate earnings were $16.2 billion with a return on capital employed of 7.9%. We generated $32.7 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales, and selectively invested $31 billion back into the business. Total shareholder distributions including dividends and share repurchases were $15 billion.\\n\\nRisk management is at the core of our business. Everything we do has an element of risk, whether technical, operational, financial, geopolitical or environmental. We have a systematic approach guided by our Operations Integrity Management System, also known as OIMS, which helps us manage safety, security, health and environmental risk.\\n\\nOIMS guides the activities of our employers and contractors to achieve excellence in our operational performance. It is a proven approach, rigorously applied to all work processes at all levels. Everyone is expected to operate in the same safe way every day, everywhere. OIMS provides appropriate emphasis on both personnel and process safety, helping us achieve superior reliability and operating performance, which ultimately leads to better business performance.\\n\\nNow let\\'s take a look at our environmental performance. At Exxon Mobil, we recognize our dual responsibility to both expand energy supplies, but do so in a way that reflects our shared commitment to environmental stewardship. To minimize our environmental impact, we carefully identify, assess, manage and monitor potential environmental risk.\\n\\nOur comprehensive approach has continued to reduce emissions and releases, mitigating the environmental impact of our operations.\\n\\nOver the past five years, 8.8 million tons of additional greenhouse gas emissions were avoided through self-help initiatives. This is equivalent to eliminating the annual greenhouse gas emissions of nearly 2 million passenger vehicles. We\\'re currently working at the operational level to minimize flaring and venting, and continue to implement proven reduction technologies such as selective deployment of cogeneration capacity in more than 100 installations at more than 30 locations around the world. Currently, our gross capacity for cogeneration is 5.5 gigawatts, enough to meet the annual electricity needs of 2.5 million U.S. homes. These investments have made our operations some of the most productive and energy efficient in the world.\\n\\nExxon Mobil is also a global leader in carbon capture and sequestration with working interest in more than one-third of the world\\'s current capacity. In total, since the year 2000, we have invested nearly $7 billion in an array of technologies across the company to reduce our emissions.\\n\\nAs this chart illustrates, our approaches are broad based and targeted at delivering practical solutions in the near term and the mid-term while continuing to make long-term investments to advance emerging energy technologies on a host of frontiers.\\n\\nMost recently, we announced an expanded research program to pursue the novel application of carbonate fuel cells to capture emissions from power plants. We are in early days, but making carbon capture economic could lead to large-scale applications around the world, reducing emissions and mitigating the risk of climate change.\\n\\nExxon Mobil also continues to research potential game-changing technologies in the areas of advanced biofuels, including from algae, whole cellulosic biomass and cellulose-derived sugars, which avoid adversely affecting water use, land use or world food supplies. But to ensure investment and innovation can progress, society will need one more thing, sound public policy. Exxon Mobil has worked for decades to support and advance scientific understanding, to contribute to substantive and thoughtful policy discourse and to reach out to stakeholders and government officials at every level wherever we operate. Nowhere is this comprehensive cooperative approach more important than addressing the risk of climate change.\\n\\nFor many years now, Exxon Mobil has held the view that the risks of climate change are serious, and they do warrant thoughtful action. We have long worked collaboratively with academic and institutional efforts to support research, improve climate models and advance the scientific understanding of climate change. Our scientists have been participating with the UN\\'s intergovernmental panel on climate change from its founding and have produced hundreds of publicly available papers including more than 50-peer-reviewed publications.\\n\\nOn the policy front, we believe that addressing the risk of climate change is a global issue, which will require the involvement of governments, companies and all energy consumers. To enable the most efficient and effective investments in lower carbon technologies, cost of carbon policies must invite and promote global participation. They must ensure a uniform and predictable cost of greenhouse gas emissions in every economy. They must allow market prices to drive the selection of solutions. They must minimize complexity and administrative cost, and maximize transparency and provide flexibility for policy adjustments in light of economic performance or new discoveries and breakthroughs in climate science. In years ahead, the world\\'s ability to meet our shared need for energy and our shared aspirations for the environment will depend on sound policy, and that is why Exxon Mobil will continue to discuss the key principles supporting a revenue-neutral carbon tax as a possible broad-based approach.\\n\\nTurning to financial results. Exxon Mobil\\'s return on capital employed consistently leads the competition. In 2015, our ROCE of 7.9% was significantly impacted by the drop in oil and gas prices, but was still nearly 4 percentage points higher than our nearest competitor. Over the past five years, our ROCE averaged 18% or about 5 percentage points higher than the next best competitor. Sustained leadership in capital efficiency reflects our commitment to a disciplined investment approach, strong project management and innovative technologies to grow a well-balanced portfolio across a broad range of business conditions.\\n\\nRegardless of the business environment, we strive to lead the cost curve and currently are benefiting from both ongoing efficiencies as well as cost deflation. As you can see by the graphic, we are achieving significant market savings in the current business climate. We achieved a total net reduction of $11.5 billion in both capital and cash operating cost in 2015. Our Upstream unit costs are down 9% and in refining, our unit cash costs are 15% lower than the industry average. This focus on cost leadership also reduces project cost, which improve long-term returns and free cash flow. Robust operating performance and relentless attention to cost control enable our ability to generate industry-leading free cash flow over the long term.\\n\\nExxon Mobil generated $6.5 billion of free cash flow in 2015 and almost $100 billion over the past five years, outpacing competitors. We continue to pay a reliable and growing dividend and pursue investments in attractive opportunities to create long-term shareholder value. Although the share buyback program was tapered in 2015, we maintain industry-leading distributions. On average, $0.48 of every dollar generated by the business over the last five years was distributed to you, our shareholders, while we continue to make significant investments in the business.\\n\\nWe continue to grow the dividend. The corporation\\'s long-term dividend growth rate exceeds the S&P 500 and our industry competitors with only Exxon Mobil materially increasing the dividend in 2015, up 6.7% to $2.88 per share. And over the past 10 years from 2006 through 2015, annual dividends have increased 10% per year. We have increased our dividend 34 consecutive years including this year\\'s second quarter increase to $0.75 per share. Our dividend payments are made with a view to building long-term shareholder value and providing a reliable dividend growth.\\n\\nShare purchases are an efficient and flexible way of returning cash to our shareholders. The corporation purchased $3 billion in 2015 and prudently tapered the program consistent with changes in the business environment and the corporation\\'s cash requirements. Through the first half of 2016, Exxon Mobil has limited share purchases to amounts needed to offset dilution related to our benefits plans and programs. While the future pace of share purchases will reflect the market environment and cash flow at the time, we continue to regard them as a flexible method to return value to the shareholders and manage our long-term capital structure.\\n\\nSince the Exxon and Mobil merger, we have reduced total shares outstanding by 40%, including the impacts of shares we issued to purchase XTO in 2010. Over this period, total shareholder distributions including dividends were $357 billion. To put this number in perspective, these distributions to you are larger than the individual market capitalization values of 497 of the S&P 500 companies.\\n\\nNow every year, Exxon Mobil shares its long-term view of global energy demand and supply, which guides our company\\'s business strategies and our investments, and we publish that as our outlook for energy. This document confirms the wisdom of these investments and help provide the world with reliable and affordable energy necessary to advance economic prosperity and improve living standards well into the future.\\n\\nBy the year 2040, the world\\'s population is expected to increase from 7 billion people today to more than 9 billion people. This population growth will more than double global economic output sparking a dramatic expansion of the middle class. These fundamentals will drive energy demand growth. As a result, Exxon Mobil\\'s 2016 outlook for energy forecasts an increase in global energy demand of about 25% during this period, even while taking into account the offsetting impact of significant energy efficiency gains.\\n\\nNon-OECD nations, shown in blue on the chart, are expected to drive growth in GDP and therefore, energy use, accounting for about 70% of global energy demand by the year 2040. The world\\'s middle class is expected to increase by about 3 billion people, mostly from non-OECD nations. This means better living standards for billions, and it will be enabled in large part by improving access to modern technology and affordable, reliable energy. They\\'re going to be able to buy microwaves. They\\'re going to be able to buy refrigeration for their food and their medicines and one day, they\\'re going to be able to buy a car. Even so, energy use per capita in developing countries will still remain below the OECD.\\n\\nThe demand outlook for OECD countries shown in red highlights the large-scale impact of energy efficiency. GDP in these countries is expected to grow about 70% between now and 2040. However, energy demand is likely to remain essentially flat as expanded use of energy-efficient technologies and practices lead to significant energy savings. Without these efficiency gains, we estimate global demand growth would be about four times our projected 25%.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll note, our energy outlook assumptions are consistent with the aggregation of Paris climate agreement commitments.\\n\\nSo now we\\'ll move to discussion of energy supplies needed to meet this growing demand. As the world\\'s population grows and living standards improve, we expect to see an evolving energy landscape, driven by advances in technology, available resources and trade. Together, oil and natural gas will meet about 60% of global demand in the year 2040, about the same percentage as they do today, and will lead growth even though the energy mix evolves.\\n\\nWe expect oil will remain the leading energy source as it remains essential to meet growing needs for transportation and as a feedstock for petrochemicals. Natural gas is abundant and well suited to meet rising power generation and industrial needs, while also providing a cost-effective option to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Natural gas demand will increase more than any other energy type, surpassing coal to become the second-largest source, in part driven by a tripling of global liquefied natural gas demand across this period.\\n\\nThe outlook anticipates that stringent government policies will increase the cost of CO2 emissions over time. These policies will incentivize the growth of energy types with low-carbon intensity, including natural gas, nuclear, solar and wind.\\n\\nOur view is grounded in the reality that abundant energy supplies are vital to modern life. Greater access to affordable and reliable energy will remain fundamental to reducing poverty and advancing standards of living for billions of people around the world.\\n\\nTo sustain progress and further expand prosperity, the world must increase the availability of affordable energy solutions. Therefore, meeting the growth in global energy demand will require diverse energy supplies from conventional and unconventional oil and gas, as well as liquefied natural gas and nuclear and renewables. We should pursue all economic opportunities.\\n\\nFortunately, technology advances continue to expand our energy options while helping to minimize our environmental footprint. Continued access to high-quality resources and substantial investments will remain fundamental in meeting these challenges. And free markets, supported by sound and reliable public policies, remain vital to the development of new energy supplies. This includes policies that promote free and open trade, and encourage private sector investments.\\n\\nSo now I\\'ll provide a business and operational update. Shown here is the Upper Zakum development, offshore Abu Dhabi, which utilizes our innovative approach of creating four artificial islands to maximize economic recovery from this very large field. Exxon Mobil, along with our partners, developed the island drilling concept, which has significantly reduced total development cost. Exxon Mobil provides industry leadership to meet the world\\'s energy needs. Key elements of our strategy are shown on this chart. Our approach has been consistent for decades, and through systematic implementation and continuous improvement, these elements have become resilient, competitive advantages.\\n\\nRisk management and operational excellence are at the very core of our business activities. Investment and cost discipline, along with world-class project execution result in the best asset mix in the industry. We continuously seek to high grade our portfolio beyond our exploration program through accretive acquisitions, restructurings and asset sales.\\n\\nAs I\\'ll discuss in the coming slides, we capture significant value-added benefits from our vertical integration. Our long-standing commitment to technology leadership stimulates innovation and provides unique advantages. And our high-performing workforce drives premier results across our businesses. Our employees are the best of the best, and their dedication produces the results that I share with you today. In short, we are delivering on our commitments and achieving differentiated performance to meet our objective of growing shareholder value.\\n\\nThe level of Exxon Mobil\\'s business integration is a sustainable, competitive advantage that is difficult to replicate, and we continue to increase that level of integration. Our businesses work together across the value chain to share knowledge, insights and best practices. This collaboration leads to better informed decisions, more efficient operations and higher quality investments, delivering unique value and resiliency. Our diverse asset base provides market optionality and operational flexibility to optimize value every step of the way from the wellhead all the way to the consumer. This structural advantage drives our differentiated financial strength and our superior results.\\n\\nAs I mentioned earlier, Exxon Mobil maintains a disciplined and paced investment approach, focused on creating long-term value. In 2016, we expect to spend around $23 billion or $8 billion less than in 2015. This plan reflects lower upstream project spending as we continue to bring major projects to completion and into production. Downstream and chemical plants reflect unique opportunities to grow and strengthen those businesses. We anticipate the 2017 budget will be less than $23 billion. We have a flexible, high-quality opportunity set and have the capability to increase the investment program based on market demand fundamentals or adjust future spending lower should conditions warrant. By selectively investing through the cycle, we remain positioned to capture market efficiencies and savings to deliver better financial returns.\\n\\nWe remain steadfast in our objective to create superior long-term value. Our planned deliverables are summarized on this chart. We manage the business to achieve industry-leading returns throughout the commodity price cycle. We work to maximize value chain benefits across the integrated portfolio, adjusting to changing product demand and improving the portfolio mix.\\n\\nCapital discipline remains paramount to our continued success. We\\'ve paced the investment program selectively, investing in attractive opportunities while maintaining our flexibility to adjust.\\n\\nUpstream volumes are an outcome of the investment program, and we anticipate a range of 4.0 million to 4.2 million oil equivalent barrels per day of production through the year 2020.\\n\\nCash flow is expected to grow from new investments, continued operating excellence, reduced spending and self-help initiatives, and we continue to share the corporation\\'s success with our shareholders. Distributions are made with a view to building long-term value by providing a reliable and growing dividend.\\n\\nNext, I\\'ll review our Upstream business. Exxon Mobil has a high-quality, diverse portfolio of assets, with oil and natural gas producing activities in 24 countries. Currently, we\\'re producing 2.3 million barrels per day of liquids and 10.5 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas. This base of operations provides long-term cash flow and the capability to progress attractive new opportunities through the cycle to meet long-term energy demand.\\n\\nWe have an extensive portfolio of approximately 100 capital projects to develop over 20 billion oil equivalent barrels, providing us multiple options that enable selective and paced investment. These projects are at varying stages of advancement, including those that are already under construction like the Odoptu Stage 2 project in Sakhalin, Russia; projects in the engineering design stage, such as the Tengiz Expansion project in Kazakhstan; and opportunities where we\\'re evaluating concepts to expand development around existing infrastructure, such as deepwater tiebacks offshore West Africa.\\n\\nWe have an unmatched opportunity base across multiple resource types, including both short and longer cycle opportunities that provide investment flexibility. Let\\'s talk about some of our recent startups. Projects that started up in 2015 added 300,000 oil equivalent barrels per day of working interest capacity. In West Africa -- in the deepwater, we added 70,000 oil equivalent barrels per day of working interest capacity with two capital-efficient projects that leveraged on existing infrastructure, the Erha North Phase 2 project in Nigeria and Kizomba Satellites Phase 2, offshore Angola. Both of these projects started up ahead of schedule and below budget. The Kearl expansion project started up five months ahead of schedule. The project incorporated learnings from the initial development phase and doubled Kearl\\'s production capacity to 230,000 barrels per day. In Indonesia, the Banyu Urip project added 75,000 barrels per day of working interest capacity. Production has now successfully ramped up to full capacity at 185,000 barrels per day.\\n\\nMoving on to 2016, 2017 startups. 10 projects are scheduled to be completed this year and next, adding more than 450,000 oil equivalent barrels per day of working interest capacity. These projects highlight the geographic resource diversity of our portfolio. As you can see, the locations range from North America to Russia, from Australia to the Middle East. Also consistent with energy demand growth projections, we are investing across several resource types, including liquefied natural gas, deepwater developments, conventional and the Arctic. We\\'re making great progress with these major construction projects with four of them starting up already this year.\\n\\nWe also have an attractive domestic onshore resource base. Our U.S. unconventional resource base is over 15 billion oil equivalent barrels. We continue to focus on liquids growth mainly through development in the Permian Basin and the Bakken plays with 2.1 million net acres and current net production of 230,000 barrels per day. In 2015, we increased our net Permian and Bakken production nearly 25%. The Permian unconventional production component nearly doubled as we increased horizontal drilling in the Wolfcamp formation in the Midland Basin.\\n\\nAdditionally, we continue to improve our acreage position through trades and farm-ins. We operate over 80% of our U.S. unconventional assets. Our ownership and operating position enable flexible development consistent with the business environment. As such, we\\'ve reduced our rig count over 70% from the peak 2015 levels while remaining positioned to adjust those levels up or down further depending on the market conditions.\\n\\nTurning to our exploration portfolio. As shown on the map, we\\'re pursuing a diverse set of high potential resource opportunities, which could add to our resource base. We hold more than 110 million net acres from under-explored regions with higher risk, but higher reward potential, to more established lower-risk basins close to existing infrastructure. We recently captured 10 new opportunities covering over 2 million net acres, gaining exposure to multiple plays in established areas as well as new emerging basins. The yellow stars marked the eight discoveries we made in 2015. We added 1.4 billion oil equivalent net barrels to our resource base, including the Liza exploration well, offshore Guyana, which was the largest oil discovery by industry in 2015. Additional resource was also added in Iraq, Nigeria, Romania, Australia and onshore North America.\\n\\nWe\\'ve accumulated an attractive position offshore Guyana, a new area with very large resource potential. We recently acquired an operating interest in the Canje Block adjacent to our existing Stabroek Block. This brings our total position to 8.1 million gross acres. To put this in perspective, this is the equivalent of 1,400 Gulf of Mexico blocks.\\n\\nFollowing the Liza-1 discovery, we completed the largest proprietary 3-dimensional seismic survey in our company\\'s history and have initiated a multi-well exploration and appraisal drilling campaign, with the spud of the Liza-2 well in February of this year. The data from this appraisal well and the 3D seismic will be used to further our understanding of the block\\'s potential and possible development concepts.\\n\\nLet\\'s now take a look at our Downstream and Chemical business. As the points on the map indicate, we have refining and petrochemicals manufacturing assets in all major regions of the world, supporting the marketing of our products in more than 130 countries. Our scale, integration and balanced portfolio of assets in fuels, lubricants and chemicals provide opportunities to capture the highest value for each molecule, while also capturing operating efficiencies.\\n\\nTo further grow the value of these businesses, we are progressing a diverse portfolio of attractive investments. Consistent with our strategy, these investments capitalize on several value chain opportunities, which include increasing feedstock and logistics flexibility.\\n\\nTo highlight a few projects underway, we are increasing our sour crude oil processing capability in Baton Rouge, Louisiana by expanding sulfur handling capacity by 40%, while also implementing steps to improve access to a broad range of North American crude oils.\\n\\nAt our refinery in Beaumont, Texas, we\\'re expanding capacity to run attractive light crude oils by 20,000 barrels per day. In chemicals, we are constructing a multibillion-dollar ethane steam cracker and associated polyethylene facilities in Texas, to capitalize on low-cost North American feedstock. When completed, these facilities will be among the world\\'s most competitive petrochemical projects through scale and integration with existing manufacturing facilities and production of premium metallocene polyethylene.\\n\\nAs mentioned earlier, at the Antwerp refinery in Belgium, we\\'re constructing a 50,000-barrel per day delayed coker to upgrade low-value bunker fuel oil currently produced at our Northern European refineries into higher value low sulfur -- ultra-low sulfur diesel.\\n\\nAt the Rotterdam refinery in the Netherlands, we are expanding the hydrocracking unit to upgrade low-value hydrocarbons into premium lube base stocks and ultra-low sulfur diesel, positioning ExxonMobil as the first large-scale producer of Group 2 base stocks in Europe.\\n\\nAt our Fawley refinery in the United Kingdom and our refinery in Singapore, we are making investments to debottleneck existing units, allowing us to upgrade distillate streams into higher value chemical intermediate products.\\n\\nEach of these projects target our most competitive strategic assets. We are also making selective investments in our lubes and chemical value chains to increase production of specialty products. We\\'re currently commissioning a specialty elastomers facility in Saudi Arabia to produce synthetic rubbers, polyolefin elastomers and carbon black to serve the auto industry.\\n\\nIn Singapore, we are expanding finished lubricant manufacturing capacity to support rapidly growing sales of our industry-leading synthetic lubricant products such as Mobil 1. Also in Singapore, construction is underway on a world scale facility to produce premium synthetic rubber for the growing tire market and premium resins for adhesive applications. These investments will strengthen ExxonMobil\\'s leading global positions in these high-growth products.\\n\\nOur direct interface with consumers is largely through our brands such as Esso, Exxon, Mobil and Mobil 1. Our broad product offering is supported by quality and reliability along with technology development, which enables us to bring new high performance products to market and further grow our brands.\\n\\nOver the past decade, we have more than doubled sales of synthetic lubricants including Mobil 1, Mobil Delvac 1 and a Mobil SHC. We\\'ve increased branded retail fuel sales by expanding our network to more than 20,000 Exxon, Mobil and Esso branded stations along with providing innovative brand marketing and technology programs to deliver a superior customer offering.\\n\\nI\\'ll conclude the business and operational update with a photo of construction under way at our world scale Baytown refining and petrochemical complex, one of the investments I described earlier. These major investment programs, whether they are new country entries or expansions of existing and legacy locations, can only succeed if we also invest in the communities where we live and work. The people of ExxonMobil understand and take seriously our responsibilities to shareholders, to communities, our neighbors and our customers to be responsible corporate citizens and to operate with the highest standards of ethical behavior. Safety and environmental protection are more than just a priority at ExxonMobil, they are core values, an integral part of our culture and fundamental to the success of our business.\\n\\nAs we develop oil and gas resources to meet the world\\'s growing energy needs, we must do so in a manner that contributes to the economic and social development of the communities in which we operate. Our efforts are directed at employing and training local workforces, supporting local suppliers and service providers and improving the livelihoods of the community members.\\n\\nWe continue to make substantial progress in training and hiring host country workers, which advances local economic development and education. For example, in Chad, 94% of our personnel are citizens of that country, and 72% of supervisory roles are held by locals. We make strategic investments to support needs of local communities. In 2015, we contributed $268 million to community initiatives around the world. Our education initiatives include programs supporting both students and teachers that encourage pursuit of careers in science, technology, engineering and math.\\n\\nFor 15 years, we have been a leader in the fight to combat preventable and treatable illnesses like malaria. To date, the antimalarial programs we have funded have reached more than 125 million people. Our support has helped train more than 520,000 health workers as well as distribute 3.8 million doses of antimalarial treatments and almost 14 million bed nets.\\n\\nWe\\'ve learned that empowering women economically is essential to local development. Through ExxonMobil\\'s women\\'s economic opportunity initiative, we invest in programs to develop the next generation of female entrepreneurs and business leaders. Through these programs, we provide the skills, resources and access to technology needed to increase their productivity and their income.\\n\\nAnd our people give not only of their personal treasure, but also their time through volunteering. Nearly 15,000 Exxon employees -- ExxonMobil employees, retirees and their families donated more than 629,000 hours to almost 5,000 charitable organizations in 34 countries around the world. It is not a slogan, but a fact. Where ExxonMobil people go, good things happen in those communities.\\n\\nIn highly capital-intensive industries such as ours, financial results and stock market returns are best viewed over a long time horizon. The energy industry requires sustainable risk management of the physical assets as well as the cash and the capital and long cycle times for investments to deliver results. ExxonMobil has generated greater shareholder returns than the average of our competitors over the last 5-, 10- and 20-year periods. These superior returns reflect our sustained financial and operating advantages that position us to maximize shareholder value.\\n\\nI want to leave you with a few personal thoughts about our company and its meaningful contributions to society. We are delivering on our business commitments in creating long-term shareholder value. Our talented, dedicated workforce drives premier results, providing reliable, affordable energy to advance human progress the world over.\\n\\nExxonMobil is more than an energy company. We\\'re making a significant difference in our communities, creating economic opportunities and improving lives by investing in better education, health care and infrastructure. We are pioneering science and advancing technologies to improve energy efficiency, reduce emissions and expand the sources of energy. We\\'ve taken thoughtful consistent action to protect the environment and to help understand and reduce the risk of climate change. I\\'m certainly proud of our employees. Who we are, what we do every day to provide energy the world needs while supporting our communities and improving the lives of people the world over.\\n\\nNow before we continue with our planned agenda items, I want to share with you a brief video that illustrates some of these meaningful contributions.\\n\\n(video playing)\\n\\nREX TILLERSON: So now, turning to the formal business of the meeting and a few brief remarks on shareholder proposals and voting. Each year, the corporation receives a number of suggestions from shareholders. Some of these are in the form of proposals to be presented at the Annual Meeting and each is given careful consideration.\\n\\nWe seek dialogues with the sponsors prior to the meeting when there is more time to better understand each other\\'s positions and we often find agreement. Let me be clear on the conduct of the meeting. Recognizing that the majority of our shareholders have voted by proxy and are not present, we have established procedures to facilitate an orderly meeting.\\n\\nWe\\'ve set up a process for speakers to identify themselves and to express their views and I assure you, we welcome those views. In order that as many shareholders as possible can participate, we have set time limits and a system of reminders to help you manage your time.\\n\\nWe have 14 items to consider. As Secretary Woodberry said earlier, discussion on all items of business will be deferred to the discussion period. This may enable us to have some time for general comments and questions as well and conclude the meeting in a reasonable time frame.\\n\\nFor those of you who may wish to leave the meeting at any time, let me express my appreciation for your attendance. Since we have a number of items yet to discuss on the program and you\\'ve been sitting for a while, I would invite you to stand and take a short stretch break and I would ask that you not leave the hall. We\\'ll resume in just a moment.\\n\\n(Break)\\n\\nREX TILLERSON: If you\\'d please take your seats. The first item of business is the election of 14 directors. I nominate the 14 persons identified on Pages 16 through 20 of the proxy statement. These 14 people are highly qualified to serve on the Board.\\n\\nAll of our nominees are currently serving as ExxonMobil directors, except for [Ms. Braly], who has been nominated by the Board for first election as a director today. All director nominees are in attendance today with the exception of Jay Fishman who was unable to attend, although I know Jay has dialed in on the Internet to the meeting.\\n\\nNow I\\'d like to ask the nominees seated to my right in the orchestra terrace to be recognized as their names are called and then I\\'ll close the nominations. Michael Boskin, Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, Angela Braly, Ursula Burns, Larry Faulkner, Henrietta Fore, Kenneth Frazier, Douglas Oberhelman, Sam Palmisano, Steve Reinemund, William Weldon and Darren Woods.\\n\\nI declare the polls open for all who want to vote in the election of directors and the 13 remaining items. If you wish to change your proxy instructions on the election of directors or any other of the 13 items or if you have not submitted a proxy and wish to vote by ballot, they are available from the ushers.\\n\\nPlease raise your hand if you would like a ballot at any time during the formal business. They will be collected after all items have been discussed.\\n\\nThe next item on the agenda is the ratification of PricewaterhouseCoopers as the independent auditors. The Audit Committee of the Board has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers to audit ExxonMobil\\'s financial statements for 2016, and we are asking shareholders to ratify that appointment.\\n\\nPricewaterhouseCoopers is represented today by Mr. Alan Page. Alan, would you please stand? Thank you.\\n\\nThe Audit Committee\\'s reasons for recommending PricewaterhouseCoopers appear in the proxy statement. I move the adoption of the proposal shown on Pages 24 and 25 of the proxy statement.\\n\\nThe next order of business is consideration of the Board-sponsored proposal regarding Executive compensation. This board proposal calls for shareholder advisory vote to approve Executive compensation as required by law. The Board recommends a vote for this proposal, as outlined on Pages 26 and 27 of the proxy statement.\\n\\nThe next order of business is consideration of the 11 shareholder proposals in the proxy statement. The first shareholder proposal regarding an independent chairman is shown on Pages 56 and 57 of the proxy statement. I understand that Beth Richtman will present the proposal. Beth, are you here? Yes.\\n\\nBETH RICHTMAN, INVESTMENT MANAGER, CALPERS: Good morning. Mr. Secretary, Chair, members of the Board and fellow shareholders. My name is Beth Richtman. I am an investment manager at CalPERS, the largest U.S. pension fund, with approximately $300 billion under management.\\n\\nCalPERS is a long-term owner with 13 million shares of ExxonMobil worth over $1 billion. I\\'m here to present Proposal Number four, which calls on Exxon to separate the positions of chair and CEO in the transition to the next CEO on behalf of the Ellen Higgins Trust.\\n\\nCalPERS firmly believes that companies with good corporate governance and sustainable business practices will outperform over the long term. In our view, a separate independent chair and CEO structure eliminates the conflicts of interest, which arise when the CEO is also responsible for board oversight. It\\'s like grading your own exam papers when you have a chair who effectively oversees the CEO.\\n\\nWith the announced retirement of Mr. Tillerson, we think it\\'s an excellent time to review Exxon\\'s leadership structure and improve the governance by separating the chair and CEO roles.\\n\\nNow is a time of great change, great risk and great opportunity for Exxon and the energy sector. Many other governments -- many other companies, large shareowners and governments all agree that the COP21 Paris agreement sets us on a path towards a low-carbon economy.\\n\\nIt is widely recognized that chairing the Board is a very time-intensive job. Having a separate chair would provide more time for Exxon\\'s CEO to focus on running the company and the Board to focus on oversight in this time of unprecedented change for the company and the energy sector.\\n\\nWith an improved governance structure and improved focus and time commitments for the key leaders at Exxon, we would also expect improved disclosure to shareowners on how Exxon is analyzing and preparing for the transition to the low-carbon economy.\\n\\nCalPERS appreciates this opportunity to address the Board directly. We think that it is unfortunate that Exxon\\'s current policy prevents the Board from having a dialogue with shareowners.\\n\\nEngagement between shareowners and directors leads to the type of productive discussion of long-term strategic issues that can prevent the necessity of shareholder proposals and proxy battles. We\\'re hopeful Exxon will end this policy of preventing these important conversations with your shareowners.\\n\\nIn closing, please join CalPERS and vote for Proposal Number four to separate the CEO and chair roles and bring our company into the realm of best practice. Because accountability and transparency are the key tenets of good governance, CalPERS has also been actively soliciting with The New York City Comptroller\\'s office for Proposal Number seven concerning proxy access and Proposal Number 12 to improve the company\\'s risk reporting concerning climate change risk. Combined, these proposals will set Exxon on a future course for success. As long-term owners and as fiduciaries, we ask for nothing less. Thank you.\\n\\nREX TILLERSON: Thank you. The Board recommends a vote against this proposal, as outlined on Page 57 of the proxy statement.\\n\\nThe next shareholder proposal calls for the addition of a climate expert to the Board and as shown on Page 58 of the proxy statement. I understand Fr. Michael Crosby will present the proposal. Fr. Crosby?\\n\\nMICHAEL CROSBY, CAPUCHIN FRANCISCAN FRIAR: Good morning, Mr. Tillerson and Board members and fellow shareholders. As Mr. Tillerson said, I am Michael Crosby. I\\'m a Capuchin Franciscan friar priest from Milwaukee. So I move our resolution. We\\'re asking for a person with climate change expertise to be on the Board for two main reasons.\\n\\nAs many of you know, ExxonMobil doesn\\'t allow its shareholders to have access to the Board, as a whole, or any of its members to discuss these issues independent of management. But the other reason, if you would look at Pages 6 to 8, is according to the references for the Board members, which are substantial, not one person has any expertise on climate.\\n\\nAnd as a result, the Board is only able to address the issue given what management says. It notes the fact that 12 members have global business credentials, that five members have financial expertise, one has some credentials in chemistry, but management\\'s own list has nobody identified with climate risk. And this is the biggest risk facing the company\\'s business, not to mention everybody on the planet. Maybe if we would have had a climate change expert on the Board, she or he would not have allowed Exxon to act in the way they did when we first filed our shareholder resolution in 1997 on climate change or maybe they wouldn\\'t have denied it for the first 10 years after we did file it.\\n\\nEven as I speak today, the company is still supporting efforts, it seems, by some to undermine state\\'s efforts to ensure the health of their people by having some kind of mitigation around climate change.\\n\\nToday, at the meeting, we heard from CalPERS and CalPERS just issued a statement that from now on, they\\'re going to be asking all companies to have somebody with climate change on their board. If that\\'s going to be for all companies, how much more for a company where almost 100% of our product and our efforts and production is related to climate change.\\n\\nI\\'d like to compliment you on the way you began your remarks. I think it\\'s the first time, and you know I\\'ve been here quite a bit, where you begin with the problem of climate change and acknowledged it. But at this stockholders meeting, with more press participating than ever, ExxonMobil has a chance to restore the public\\'s trust. This calls for conversion. I like the kiosk out there that talked about the drone and we can create disruptive change, you said.\\n\\nWe don\\'t want disruptive change. We want constructive change and this conversion invites us to change. As a Catholic priest, I join Pope Francis in believing that conversion is possible to more and more efforts around renewables. And so as a result of that, I urge support for our resolution. Thank you.\\n\\nREX TILLERSON: Thank you, Fr. Crosby. The Board recommends a vote against this proposal, as outlined on Pages 58 and 59 of the proxy statement.\\n\\nThe next shareholder proposal, to hire an investment bank as shown on Page 59 of the proxy statement. I understand that Tracey Rembert will present the proposal. Ms. Rembert?\\n\\nTRACEY REMBERT, SHAREHOLDER, CHRISTIAN BROTHERS INVESTMENT SERVICES: Thank you, fellow shareholders, Mr. Tillerson and the Board. My name is Tracey Rembert and I\\'m here representing Christian Brothers Investment Services, which is a Catholic investment manager with over $6 billion in assets under management. We\\'ve been a longtime shareholder of ExxonMobil with over 329,000 shares currently, and we want to formally move Item Number Six, Ken Steiner\\'s proposal on hiring an investment bank to break up the company.\\n\\nWhile we don\\'t agree with this proposal, we are moving it as a formal courtesy to a fellow shareholder. We do think it -- we\\'re at an interesting time in discussion of the company and its current business model. But we haven\\'t given up on ExxonMobil just yet. We think that you can be prepared for a diversified energy future, but we can\\'t keep having these conversations year-over-year. I think in terms of action that\\'s needed, solutions that need to come to the table, I really hope I\\'m not here 10 years from now having the same conversations and the company has dramatically started to address some of the issues raised.\\n\\nI\\'m here to talk about impact on the world\\'s poor, and issues continue to circle around the company about the nimbleness of your current business model to be able to address issues. Exxon presents a false choice between providing reliable and affordable energy and addressing climate change. We don\\'t think it\\'s an either/or. We think right now, absolutely, both issues need to be addressed. Impacts the world\\'s poorest communities, including those in the global South, are happening now. Climate change is not some abstract thing likely to happen 80 or 100 years from now. It is here, and it is visceral, and it\\'s devastating the world\\'s poor people, and Exxon has said for over a decade that it wants to provide affordable energy to the world\\'s poor, but only through business as usual measures, but we expect more.\\n\\nWe question whether lives will actually be improved in low-income communities if they are regularly suffering from the impacts of drought, extreme weather, geopolitical upheaval due to climate change and other factors. We want to hear from our company how you will begin to address these impacts that are a consequence of your core products and current business model.\\n\\nThis is not about \"abundant energy supply\" as you just mentioned in some of your remarks earlier. This is about abundant ultra-low carbon energy supply for the masses that want energy. This is what is needed.\\n\\nWe currently question whether ExxonMobil long term will do more harm than good with its current business strategy. And, therefore, we really urge you, Mr. Tillerson, especially the Board, as new leadership comes in, it\\'s now or never.\\n\\nThe impacts to the world\\'s poor -- we\\'ve far surpassed, I think, the point where people are suffering and we\\'d really like to see Exxon bring some viable solution to the table, not just talking about small investments in an energy transition. We do want to see Exxon actually steer us to a low-carbon path. Thank you.\\n\\nREX TILLERSON: Thank you, Ms. Rembert. The Board recommends a vote against this proposal, as outlined on Page 59 of the proxy statement.\\n\\nThe next shareholder proposal for a proxy access bylaw is shown on Page 59 and 60 of the proxy statement. I understand that Michael Garland will present the proposal. Mr. Garland?\\n\\nMICHAEL GARLAND, ASSISTANT COMPTROLLER FOR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT, OFFICE OF NEW YORK CITY COMPTROLLER: Good morning Mr. Chairman, members of the board and fellow shareowners. I\\'m with the office of New York City Comptroller, Scott Stringer, and I\\'m presenting Proposal Seven on behalf of The New York City Pension Funds.\\n\\nThese funds have $160 billion in assets and are substantial, long-term ExxonMobil shareowners. We\\'re voting 10.5 million shares at today\\'s meeting valued at nearly $1 billion and this represents the retirement security for New York City\\'s teachers, firefighters, police and other loyal city employees.\\n\\nProposal seven calls for a proxy access bylaw to enable shareowners that have collectively held at least 3% of the company for three years to include a limited number of director candidates on the company ballot.\\n\\nThe proposed bylaw is intended to give substantial long-term shareowners a meaningful voice in electing the directors responsible for overseeing the company\\'s long-term strategy and risks, including risks related to climate change.\\n\\nProxy access will enable Exxon shareowners to ensure that the Board is made up of independent and accountable directors who have the diverse mix of relevant skills, experience and perspectives necessary to navigate these challenges and create long-term shareowner value.\\n\\nThe proposed bylaw includes appropriate safeguards to prevent abuse, a 3% interest in Exxon is currently valued at over $11 billion. By any measure, a significant stake in the company\\'s future. There\\'ve been extraordinary developments since last year\\'s Annual Meeting when the proposal received 49% of votes cast and these highlight why this is a defining moment for the board and why proxy access is so important for Exxon shareowners.\\n\\nOxford University released a study that found that major oil companies face significant risks from groupthink because they make large lumpy investments with long time horizons. The study found that Exxon had the least diverse board, particularly with respect to age range, nationality and industry experience among the six largest oil and gas companies in the world, publicly traded, and was therefore most exposed to risks of groupthink.\\n\\n175 companies -- 175 countries signed the Paris agreement, demonstrating that there\\'s global political will to limit carbon emissions, a scenario the Board must take more seriously.\\n\\nThe Saudi government announced dramatic steps to prepare its economy for the inevitability of a low-carbon future. Major oil companies like BP and Shell have supported shareowner requests for climate risk reporting similar to Proposal 12, which The New York City funds have joined with CalPERS to actively support along with proxy access.\\n\\nFinally, since last year\\'s meeting, more than 200 U.S. companies have enacted proxy access bylaws on terms similar to Proposal Seven. They include the largest U.S. oil companies other than Exxon. They include seven companies at which Exxon directors also serve as directors.\\n\\nMany of these companies have voluntarily enacted proxy access without the need for a vote, including more than 70% of the 72 companies that received proposals from New York City this year.\\n\\nExxon\\'s board is an outlier in its continuing opposition to proxy access, the climate risk reporting and to engaging directly with shareowners. It\\'s time for the board to demonstrate its commitment to an accountable system of corporate governance that fosters long-term value creation.\\n\\nWe urge shareowners to vote for Proposal Seven. Thank you.\\n\\nREX TILLERSON: Thank you, Mr. Garland. The Board recommends a vote against this proposal, as outlined on Pages 60 and 61 of the proxy statement.\\n\\nThe next shareholder proposal calls for a report on compensation for women and is shown on Pages 61 and 62 of the proxy statement. I understand that Tom Sifferman will present this proposal.\\n\\nTOM SIFFERMAN, REPRESENTATIVE, MOBIL OIL: Thank you, sir. It\\'s good to be back here again, Chairman. The Board of Directors, shareholders, this is my second time presenting this. My name is Tom Sifferman as indicated. I\\'m a Ph. D. and Registered/Licensed Professional Engineer and speaking on behalf of Eve Sprunt, my former coworker at Mobil Oil. She\\'s a Ph. D.\\n\\nI have eight bullet items, most of it it\\'s in the proxy statement, but one thing I wanted to say is that there is no doubt that Exxon from ExxonMobil\\'s statement in the proxy that they are attempting to help women advance.\\n\\nThe question is how effective those actions have been? Subtle and subconscious prejudice is difficult to combat as a major factor for women\\'s underrepresentation in leadership roles. The value that is placed one someone\\'s role within a company is reflected in their monetary compensation.\\n\\nWomen in management and executive ranks are often underrepresented and support functions that are less well compensated instead. The results of ExxonMobil\\'s actions are -- if they are so good, please show us the money, that\\'s the important thing, provide data on how women\\'s compensation compares with men\\'s at all levels. The Bureau of Statistics and Labor reports that 76% of human resource managers are female, but on the average, their pay is only 71% of their male counterparts. If human resource managers, who are the company\\'s watchdogs can\\'t take care of themselves, who can?\\n\\nThe proof of how successful the efforts are is in the money. Again, show us the money. We need to see the data. If, and that\\'s a question if, if ExxonMobil is a leader in advancing women the compensation data should be a valuable recruiting tool to attract the best and brightest women, let\\'s use it for our advantage. As shareholders, we want ExxonMobil to succeed in advancing women to attract and retain the most advanced, most talented and productive women.\\n\\nWomen also invest money in different funds and fund managers now days don\\'t seem to be too concerned about sending female investors a message that there should be pay transparency. Basically, show us the money. Thank you very much.\\n\\nREX TILLERSON: Thank you, Mr. Sifferman. The Board recommends a vote against this proposal, as outlined on Pages 62 and 63 of the proxy statement.\\n\\nThe next shareholder proposal calls for a report on lobbying and is shown on Pages 63 and 64 of the proxy statement. I understand that Hughes Jenkins will present the proposal. Mr. Jenkins?\\n\\nHUGHES JENKINS, EMPLOYEE, UNITED STEELWORKERS: Fellow shareholders and members of the board, my name is Hughes Jenkins, and I\\'m a nine-year employee at ExxonMobil in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. On behalf of the United Steelworkers and (inaudible) followers, I hereby move Item Nine. The proposal asking our company to provide a report on state and federal lobbying expenditures including indirect funding of lobbying through trade associations and support for the American Legislative Exchange Council known as ALEC.\\n\\nIllustrating the deep international concern about lobbying and climate change, AP7, a Swedish pension fund, which owns over 3.4 million shares joined as a co-filer this year. Transparency and accountability in corporate spending to influence public policy are the best -- are in the best interest of ExxonMobil shareholders, and a high profile investigation into whether our company mislead investors on climate change only underscores the importance of full disclosure.\\n\\nCorporations contribute millions of dollars to trade associations, they\\'re directly -- they lobby indirectly on their behalf without specific disclosure or accountability. ExxonMobil does not even disclose its trade association membership nor the portions of these payments used for lobbying, so shareholders currently have no way to know how much ExxonMobil\\'s trade association contributions are being used to lobby on its behalf.\\n\\nExxonMobil also contributes to tax-exempt organizations [their] right and endorse model state legislation playing a key role in ALEC. ALEC has attracted negative attention for its role in promoting bills on anti-immigration policies, and also blocking EPA regulation on climate change. ALEC also promotes legislation that seeks to diminish workers\\' rights in our country. As a proud member of the United Steelworkers Union, I find many of ALEC\\'s proposed laws to be distasteful.\\n\\nThis is one of the reasons why we are seeking full disclosure on lobbying. Our company argument against Item Nine suggests shareholders can use government (inaudible) to get this information, but public information does not provide a clear picture of ExxonMobil\\'s lobbying expenditures, nor is it easy to assess.\\n\\nWe urge shareholders to vote for this proposal to mandate our company supply this important report. Thank you.\\n\\nREX TILLERSON: Thank you, Mr. Jenkins. The Board recommends a vote against this proposal, as outlined on pages 64 and the 65 of the proxy statement.\\n\\nThe next proposal calls for a commitment to increase the total amount authorized for capital distributions and is shown on Page 65 and 66 of the proxy statement. I understand that [Natasha Lamb], will present the proposal. Ms. Lamb?\\n\\nNATASHA LAMB, DIRECTOR OF EQUITY RESEARCH, ARJUNA CAPITAL AND BALDWIN BROTHERS: Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the Board and fellow shareholders. My name is Natasha Lamb, and I am here on behalf of Arjuna Capital and Baldwin Brothers\\' client Eric MacCallum to move Proposal Number 10, which asks our company to prioritize profitability and value over growth by returning more capital to shareholders.\\n\\nWe ask this in light of increasingly risky investments in potentially stranded carbon assets. That is carbon assets we can\\'t burn without irreversible climate disruption. Implementing the proposal would represent a prudent, albeit, disciplined path forward in the face of unburnable carbon assets, which represent approximately two-thirds of proven global reserves according to the International Energy Agency.\\n\\nThese reserves cannot be burned when the Paris Climate Agreement established by 196 countries to prevent a less than 2 degrees Celsius rise in global temperature goes into effect. For a while, the business plan of extracting as much carbon as quickly as possible was a winner, last century, that same plan will destroy value this century and already has. Historic levels of capital spend on growth assets has eroded profitability and Exxon\\'s risk profile, return on equity and return on invested capital are at historic lows.\\n\\nProfitability has fallen 68% over the last decade and Exxon\\'s sterling credit rating has just been downgraded, increasing the company\\'s cost of capital. Continuing to grow high cost fossil fuel reserves in the face of global climate change disruptive agreement is no longer prudent.\\n\\nCitigroup estimates unburnable fossil fuel reserves could amount to over $1 trillion out to 2050. While the Carbon Tracker Initiative estimates that as oil majors choose to undertake projects consistent with a 2-degree demand level, combined upstream assets would actually be worth $140 billion more.\\n\\nWe are asking our company to prioritize value over growth, investing in the most profitable core carbon assets and returning a greater percentage of profits to shareholders, which would allow Exxon to decrease in size while increasing profitability, essentially shifting from a business plan of growth for growth\\'s sake to one of value.\\n\\nTo the opposite end, profitability has decreased, while total capital distributions have fallen for the last three years, by 35% last year and they\\'re projected to fall 50% in 2016 from 2014 levels. I urge shareholders, management and the board to fully consider this strategically important issue at such a critical juncture. Thank you.\\n\\nREX TILLERSON: Thank you, Ms. Lamb. The board recommends a vote against this proposal as outlined on Pages 66 and 67 of the proxy statement.\\n\\nThe next shareholder proposal calls for a policy to limit global temperature increases to 2 degrees centigrade and is shown on Pages 67 and 68 of the proxy statement. I understand that Sister Patricia Daly will present the proposal.\\n\\nPATRICIA DALY, SISTERS OF ST. DOMINIC OF CALDWELL NEW JERSEY: Good morning, Mr. Tillerson. How are you today?\\n\\nREX TILLERSON: I\\'m well. Thank you.\\n\\nPATRICIA DALY: Good morning, everybody, and members of the board. My name is Sister Patricia Daly. I\\'m a Dominican Sister of Caldwell, New Jersey, the lead filer along with 32 other institutional investors, most of whom -- many of whom are here today, but most of whom are members of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, representing faith-based initiatives, institutions, Native American tribes, health care systems and asset management firms.\\n\\nI move Item 11 on the proxy, which asks ExxonMobil to adopt a policy acknowledging the imperative to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius. This resolution calls for moral leadership on the part of our company. Accepting the moral obligation of the 2-degree target in the midst of the climate crisis is surely the lowest hurdle our company will face on this issue.\\n\\nInstead, in opposing this resolution, our company has chosen to disregard the consensus of the scientific community, the will of 195 nations that signed the Paris Agreement in December, many of our peers in the oil and gas industry and the calls of faith leaders from the Catholic, Jewish, Christian, Muslim, Buddhist and interfaith traditions. I\\'m particularly and personally challenged by our Pope Francis in his encyclical letter, Laudato Si\\', that was published last year, a reflection to all peoples on the planet on our common home. I hope people here may take the time to read that.\\n\\nOpposing this resolution positions our company against a movement for climate justice. As the world moves forward, ExxonMobil stands still. Every day, new reports and incidents demonstrate the importance of the 2-degree target for the sake of our planet for future generations and vulnerable communities, communities hit hardest by climate change. Record wildfires still rage in Alberta, disrupting the production of the very tar sands fueling global warming. We can see impacts today all around us.\\n\\nIn a world already facing the worst refugee crisis in generations, continued conflict and war and projected extreme heat waves that will render parts of the world uninhabitable, we must limit our warming to 2 degrees. Decades have been lost in the fight against climate change due in part to our company\\'s deliberate campaign of disinformation.\\n\\nMr. Tillerson, last year, at the oil and gas -- the annual Oil & Money Conference, you said and I quote, \"There\\'s also a humanitarian dimension and a moral imperative to what we do.\" Today, we ask our company to acknowledge the full breadth of its moral imperative, moral responsibilities to provide the solutions to energy poverty while limiting global warming to less than 2 degrees. Anything less is a false solution for the world\\'s poorest and most vulnerable. Please join your peers like Shell, BP and Saudi Aramco who stated, and I quote, \"Our shared ambition is for a 2-degree future. It\\'s a challenge for the whole of society. We are committed to playing our part.\" Now ExxonMobil must play its part, too.\\n\\nMr. Tillerson, you said earlier in the energy outlook that you believe that the energy outlook is in line with the 2-degree limit. If you really believe that, why would you and our Board of Directors recommend a vote against this resolution? Thank you.\\n\\nREX TILLERSON: Thanks, Sister Pat. The board recommends a vote against this proposal as outlined on Pages 68 and 69 of the proxy statement.\\n\\nThe next shareholder proposal calls for a report on impacts of climate change policies and is shown on Pages 69 and 70 of the proxy statement. I understand that Edward Mason will present the proposal. Mr. Mason?\\n\\nEDWARD MASON, SHAREHOLDER, CHURCH COMMISSIONERS FOR ENGLAND: Thank you. Chairman, members of the board, shareholders, good morning. My name is Edward Mason from the Church Commissioners for England, who manage the Church of England\\'s endowment. We\\'re long-term shareholders interested in the sustainable success of the companies in which we invest, and it\\'s a pleasure to be here in Dallas for Exxon\\'s annual meeting.\\n\\nThe Church Commissioner is a lead co-filer of shareholder Proposal Number 12, which was filed by New York State Common Retirement Fund, whom I\\'m also representing. The resolution asks Exxon to publish annually an analysis of how its portfolio stress tests against a scenario in which the world restricts warming to 2 degrees. This is a reasonable request.\\n\\nChairman, as you have acknowledged this morning, climate change is real. The desire of global governments to restrict warming to below 2 degrees, affirmed in the Paris Agreement, is real. The financial risks and opportunities for companies associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy are real. These risks have been recognized by the global Financial Stability Board chaired by the governor of the Bank of England, which has created a task force on climate-related financial disclosure.\\n\\nExxon\\'s peers have agreed to provide regular portfolio resilience reporting, including BP, Shell and Total. At BP and Shell\\'s annual meetings last year, the reporting request was endorsed by 98% of shareholders at both companies. Because of Exxon\\'s decision to diverge from its peers and oppose the request in this resolution, management will today experience a major shareholder revolt.\\n\\nChairman, the board is losing the confidence of its investors on climate change. In the run-up to this annual meeting, investors with over $10 trillion of assets affirmed their support for this shareholder proposal.\\n\\nMany of the world\\'s largest asset managers are voting against management today -- Aegon, Amundi, Aviva Investors, AXA Investment Managers, BMO Global Asset Management, BNP Paribas Investment Partners, HSBC Global Asset Management, Legal & General Investment Management, Natixis Asset Management, Robeco and Schroders. The world\\'s largest sovereign wealth fund, the Norwegian Government Pension Fund, pension schemes from around the world from the public and private sector alike and church investors like us from three continents are all voting against management.\\n\\nChairman and members of the board, Exxon can do better. Following today\\'s vote, the investors backing this proposal look forward to starting afresh and having a responsive and productive engagement with the company on climate-related disclosures.\\n\\nREX TILLERSON: Thank you, Mr. Mason. The board recommends a vote against this proposal as outlined on Pages 70 and 71 of the proxy statement.\\n\\nThe next shareholder proposal calls for the company to report reserve replacement in BTUs and is shown on Page 71 of the proxy statement. I understand that Danielle Fugere will present the proposal. Ms. Fugere?\\n\\nDANIELLE FUGERE: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen of the board, Mr. Chairman and all shareholders gathered here today, good morning. My name is Danielle Fugere. Thank you for the opportunity to move Item 13 entitled Carbon Asset Transition. This proposal sends a clear message that shareholders want our company to prepare to thrive in the coming clean energy economy. It\\'s becoming clear, and I think we\\'ve heard today, that business as usual is no longer a viable strategy for the 21st century and in fact is incompatible with a livable planet.\\n\\nRecognizing the urgency facing businesses to respond to climate change, this proposal seeks to provide a means by which our company can move beyond the current business model, begin to respond to new opportunities and consider becoming an energy company for the future.\\n\\nThis proposal asks Exxon to account for energy reserves in resource-neutral BTUs, or British thermal units, an internationally accepted energy unit, in addition to the traditional barrels of oil equivalent. Since Exxon already uses BTUs, this reporting is not difficult to accomplish. And this seemingly minor accounting tweak will have major consequences. It will help our economy and the market account for and place value on a range of energy resources beyond just oil and gas, including geothermal, cellulosic biofuels, wind, solar and other energy resources. By aligning one of the market\\'s primary valuation metrics, reserve replacement, with this imperative for lower carbon energy, a path to become a truly diversified and competitive energy can be forged.\\n\\nCurrently, in oil and gas companies, market value is based in large part on reserve replacement ratio. Did the company replace every used barrel of oil it produced with a newly discovered barrel of oil? If annual oil reserve replacement isn\\'t 100% or greater, a company\\'s stock market value may be impaired. Unfortunately, we saw both of these things happen to Exxon this year when S&P downgraded the company\\'s credit, it noted that in its view, the company\\'s greatest business challenge is replacing its ongoing production.\\n\\nThe all-important reserve replacement metric locks management into an endless hunt for more oil and gas. So shareholders look to Exxon to be a leader in beginning the inevitable transition to becoming a diversified energy company, able to compete in a decarbonizing economy. Imagine energy analysts looking at Exxon\\'s filings in the future and seeing 67% of barrels of oil equivalent replacement and 100% BTUs, and then the next year, 60% barrels replaced and again, 100% BTUs. This tells a story of a company in transition to not only survive, but thrive in a clean energy economy. We urge shareholders to vote in support of proxy Item 13. Thank you for your attention.\\n\\nREX TILLERSON: Thank you, Ms. Fugere. The board recommends a vote against this proposal as outlined on Page 72 of the proxy statement.\\n\\nThe last shareholder proposal calls for a report on hydraulic fracturing and is shown on Pages 72 and 73 of the proxy statement. And I understand, Ms. Fugere, you will present this proposal as well.\\n\\nDANIELLE FUGERE: Thank you. I\\'m also presenting Item 14, a shareholder proposal requesting Exxon to increase its transparency on hydraulic fracturing operations. A similar proposal was filed last year and received 25% support from voting share owners.\\n\\nRather than improving its transparency, however, Exxon has remained a laggard in demonstrating to shareholders that it is using practices that reduce risk and reduce harms. In the face of well-known environmental and social impacts, the public has continued to pass restrictions and moratoria, limiting business opportunities and imposing a wide range of costs on companies, from the cost of delay to complete loss of access to valuable resources, all of which materially impact investors\\' holdings. Improved reporting helps reassure the public that companies are addressing local issues such as air and water pollution, truck traffic and noise and competition for water in water-scarce areas.\\n\\nLocal issues require local reporting, thus we ask the company to report on local issues on a play-by-play basis, so that neighbors can understand specifically what the company is doing in their neighborhood. If Exxon reports worldwide reductions in air pollution, that does nothing to alleviate concerns of local community members about what the company might be doing in their neighborhoods.\\n\\nBetter reporting also provides information as to whether the company is using best practices in places where they are not legally required to do so. Stating that the company follows the law is not useful in places where the law doesn\\'t sufficiently protect communities. Methane leakage is a good example. The public and lawmakers are focused like lasers on the issue of whether companies are monitoring or/and addressing methane leakage where it occurs. If leaks aren\\'t addressed, natural gas may become worse for the climate than coal. While methane leakage laws are being developed, it\\'s critically important that industry and Exxon get out in front of the issue and trumpet the actions they are taking to prevent or address methane leaks.\\n\\nExxon is currently far behind other companies in its reporting. Leaders like BHP Billiton, Hess, Apache, CONSOL and Noble Energy earned top scores this year in a report called Disclosing the Facts, while Exxon rated near the bottom, again, far behind its peers and frankly, behind where such a leading company should be. Peer reporting has earned these other companies accolades, and the sky hasn\\'t fallen around them.\\n\\nIn the absence of meaningful disclosures, shareholders have no way to fully assess the steps Exxon is taking, both over time and relative to peers, regarding its actions to reduce the impact of its shale oil and gas operations. It\\'s beyond time that Exxon begin to demonstrate leadership in this important area. We encourage shareholders to vote for proxy Item number 14 to increase Exxon\\'s transparency and communicate on these important issues. Thank you.\\n\\nREX TILLERSON: Thank you, Ms. Fugere. The board recommends a vote against this proposal as outlined on Pages 73 and 74 of the proxy statement.\\n\\nAll items of business have now been introduced. I invite any of you who want to, to stand and stretch your legs again for a minute. And for those of you who wish to address the meeting in the discussion period, this would be a good time for you to move toward the aisle to the reserved seats, so you\\'ll have ready access to a microphone.\\n\\n(Break)\\n\\nREX TILLERSON: Okay, let\\'s resume the meeting, so if you would take your seats please.\\n\\nI would now open the floor for discussion on the items of business presented. I\\'d like to emphasize that your comments should be limited to only the board and shareholder proposals in the proxy statement at this time. As I said earlier, we\\'ll try to set some time aside to address other topics if we have time remaining. We received a number of questions on proxy cards and through our website. As time permits, we\\'ll try to get to some of those.\\n\\nAs described earlier, move to the aisle if you\\'ve not already done so, or if not already seated nearby. Remain seated and raise your speaker identification card to indicate you want to address the meeting. When recognized, give your completed speaker identification card to the usher, and a microphone will be provided. Stand and begin by stating your name and the board or shareholder proposal you want to comment on. Bear in mind the rules of conduct shown in the program. Make your comments as brief as possible so that we can allow as many people to address the meeting as wish to do so. We\\'ll continue to use the lighting system to help you manage your time. First priority will be given to those who have not yet had an opportunity to speak. So I would welcome your questions or comments at this time.\\n\\nQuestions and Answers\\n\\nREX TILLERSON: There in the back.\\n\\nDAVID RIESMAN, SHAREHOLDER: Fellow shareholders -- oh sorry. My name is David Riesman. I\\'m speaking on Item Nine, lobbying. Fellow shareholders, member of the board, I\\'m here representing Yale University\\'s Dwight Hall, one of the co-filers of the lobbying proposal.\\n\\nYale and over 1,000 academics have publicly indicated support of this proposal. In the past year, Exxon has come under unprecedented scrutiny of its political spending and public policy positions, including ongoing investigations by the state attorney general to determine whether ExxonMobil deliberately misled the public and investors. This investigation and the risk it poses to shareholder value underscore the need to improve disclosure and oversight of our company\\'s lobbying, especially through third parties.\\n\\nExxon publicly supports a carbon tax and acknowledges the realities of climate change, but its lobbying practices appear to conflict with his positions. Exxon\\'s management justifies its support of organizations that obstruct climate policy by claiming that Exxon supports some, but not all, of the actions of such organizations.\\n\\nHowever, because Exxon is an oil and gas company, the company\\'s exposure to climate policy obstructionism is in danger of being construed as intentional. We believe that ExxonMobil shareholders deserve to understand the process by which the company contributes to organizations whose positions contradict Exxon\\'s stated principles, blocking progress on climate change.\\n\\nIt\\'s hard to take these principles in good faith while seeing these contradictory practices. For example, Exxon is an active leader and funder of ALEC, a primary agent of climate policy obstructionism. The company has justified participation in ALEC on the basis of the organization\\'s STEM lobbying, among others.\\n\\nHowever, Exxon can pursue STEM lobbying through other organizations. Recently, 100 companies have publicly left ALEC. Many companies, including Shell and BP, have determined that ALEC\\'s harmful climate obstruction outweighs any of ALEC\\'s benefits. Given that ALEC\\'s harmful policy obstruction seems to overshadow any other membership benefits, why is this company still associated with ALEC? Thank you.\\n\\nREX TILLERSON: Thank you. Other speakers? All right, down here. I didn\\'t hear a question.\\n\\nDAVID RIESMAN: Why the company is still associated with ALEC, given the previous statements?\\n\\nREX TILLERSON: Well, ALEC, as you probably know, is an organization of state legislators and legislative bodies, over 400 members. And most of the most productive legislation in this country is passed at state levels.\\n\\nWe have found our engagement with them to be very productive in a number of broad areas, whether it\\'s tax policy, other regulatory areas, particularly educational reform, and that is why we remain engaged with them. We find them to be a highly competent and very thoughtful policy organization. Whether we agree with the positions they ultimately take or not, we find the engagement very useful to our understanding of these issues, and we intend to continue.\\n\\nDown here.\\n\\nMICHAEL MACCRACKEN, CHIEF SCIENTIST, CLIMATE CHANGE SCIENTIST, MERCY INVESTMENT SERVICES: Thank you. Mr. Tillerson, members of the board, my name is Michael MacCracken. I\\'ve been a climate change scientist for nearly 50 years, and I\\'m here on behalf of Mercy Investment Services, speaking with respect to the items raised in Proposals 11 and 12.\\n\\nAt last year\\'s shareholder meeting, Mr. Tillerson, you responded to an audience question that climate model results were too uncertain to be reliable, and that if emissions cutbacks were not sufficient, engineering ways would emerge and serve as plan B. While we\\'ll have no -- or we\\'ll have no choice but to try and adapt, I\\'d suggest that the international scientific community would take strong exception to the viewpoints you expressed with respect to what it means with regards to national and international policies.\\n\\nOn the first point, in DOE\\'s major, widely peer-reviewed 1985 climate change assessment that preceded IPCC, Exxon\\'s leading climate change scientist for the past several decades, Dr. Brian Flannery, coauthored the chapter on projecting climate change. That chapter concluded that quote, \"Climate models currently available when run with standard scenarios of fossil fuel CO2 emissions indicate a global warming of the order of 1 degrees C by the year 2000 relative to the year 1850, an additional 2 to 5 degrees C warming over the next century.\" So that projection was made three decades ago, and it\\'s still the case today. Basically, we\\'ve had a good sense of what the large-scale outcomes were, but the actions we have taken have really not changed things much.\\n\\nIndeed, as you said last year, improving climate models and having more data and computer resources have been helpful, but there are inevitable uncertainties. The top line conclusions, however, have not changed over this entire period. The main reason now for the differences between models is with respect to the choices we make with what energy technologies we have, what emissions we have. So basically, we need to decide what\\'s going to happen with respect to the future.\\n\\nWith the potential -- with respect to the potential for mitigation -- with adapting, all major assessments indicate that it\\'s going to be very hard technologically and economically to adapt to a lot of the different consequences, biodiversity and other things.\\n\\nSo my question would relate to these resolutions, have to do with what due diligence analyses ExxonMobil has done to date with respect to the likelihood and what we\\'re finding in the scientific community, the consequences are becoming more severe -- likely to be more severe than IPCC has been projecting? And what win-win solutions ExxonMobil is looking for to try and meet the more aggressive actions that are going to be needed to meet the Paris accord and objectives.\\n\\nREX TILLERSON: Well, as you and I have spoken before, my view on the competency of the models has really not changed. And in fact, that is reflected in the IPCC\\'s own FAQs. In the FAQs following the Paris climate accord, the question was asked of the IPCC panel, is there a scientific basis for the 2-degree centigrade target?\\n\\nAnd you can go to the FAQ and find this for yourself. I\\'m going to paraphrase it. The answer is no. There is and they say it, they go on to say there is no scientific basis for the 2-degrees centigrade target. The target has been one chosen by society in a general consensus process. I take no exception to that, okay? So we can set the science apart from what we, as society, decide we\\'re going to choose to pursue as a matter of policy.\\n\\nSo now your question is as a matter of policy. And I said to you relative to the understanding of the science, there\\'s no space between us and the IPCC. We see the science the same way. Our differences on policy choices are, I think, one that is grounded in reality. And the reality is, there is no alternative energy source known on the planet or available to us today to replace the pervasiveness of fossil fuels in our global economy and on our very quality of life, and I would go beyond that and say our very survival.\\n\\nSo it is a judgment of balance between future climatic events, which could prove to be catastrophic, but are unknown by the IPCC\\'s own acknowledgment, and more immediate needs of humanity today to address poverty, starvation, broad-based disease control and the quality of life of billions that people who are still living in today, which is unacceptable to many of us. And the only way out of that is to provide them the energy sources we have today. And that\\'s why we continue to believe fossil fuels will have a significant and important role to play for as far as we can see. And no government studies disagree with that.\\n\\nSo then your second question is what do we do? So then what we do is we have now, for more than three decades, focused our research efforts on given that, that is the case, how can we provide people the capability to use these fuels and these energy sources in a less impactful way? And in the early days, we invested in enormous amounts of time and energy on energy efficiency. How can I continue to carry out my activities consuming the same amount of fossil fuels and have a lower impact on the atmosphere and the surrounding environment? And we continue that.\\n\\nWe have advanced our technology investigations, and I addressed them today. We think one of the important breakthroughs that is needed is in carbon capture sequestration. If, in fact, our view is -- turns out to be true and the world\\'s going to have to continue to use fossil fuels whether they like it or not, if we can achieve a breakthrough on carbon capture sequestration, we can continue using fossil fuels, capturing the carbon in an economic way and sequestering it. And that is a huge if, but it\\'s also a huge breakthrough that would change things dramatically. A lot of people are working on that. And we\\'ve been working on it on a very long time. And I mentioned today a new endeavor we have entered into that we believe has promise, but we also know it is many years away from perfection.\\n\\nSo those are the kinds of things we are doing. So we are not ignoring the risk that is out there. And I think as you and I discussed, I don\\'t think we see it all that differently. Our differences are how we think we\\'re going to address it. And again, we are grounded in the reality of the world we live in today and what is known technologically to us today. And I would invite you to read a piece that Bill Gates recently wrote where he has undertaken on himself to support research. And he would come to the same conclusion. He and I have had this conversation. There\\'s no space between we -- he and I on this either. We\\'ve got to have some technology breakthroughs. But until we achieve those, just saying turn the taps off is not acceptable to humanity. Thank you.\\n\\nMICHAEL MACCRACKEN: If I may just for a moment respond on the issue of the Paris levels. I mean, it is the case that there\\'s no sort of sharp threshold because consequences are getting worse and worse and worse. And society has set that partly as a political one because it can\\'t achieve what the scientific community would suggest, which is -- it was about 0.5 degree warming when we started losing mass from Greenland and the Antarctic ice sheets. And what paleoclimatic evidence talks about and would say, coming out of the last glacial and as has been the case in the past history, is that sea level rise ultimately is of the order of 15 to 20 meters per degree C warming in global average temperature. It\\'s tremendous, not something that is easily adapted to.\\n\\nSo yes, society chose an arbitrary level, and they haven\\'t committed yet to try and even -- made the commitments to even get to that level. But really, they should be pushing down and doing all they can. And that\\'s what we\\'re basically asking for is doing all that can be done with regard to cutting emissions.\\n\\nREX TILLERSON: I understand, and so I\\'m going to respond to a couple of points you made there, and then we\\'re going to move on to another speaker. The factors that you just described, 15 meters, half a degree C, there are a large number of alternative views that suggest those are the most extreme outcomes. And in fact, an IPCC scientific paper, as you well know, they show a very broad range. So you are focusing on the worst possible combination of events from all of the possible scenarios. We choose to look at it as a range of risk, and that\\'s the way we manage our business as well. And again, I don\\'t think there\\'s any space between us other than the solutions that we think we have to pursue.\\n\\nYes, sir, in the middle?\\n\\nDAVID MARTINEAU, GEOLOGIST: My name is [David Martineau]. I\\'m a geologist, and I\\'ve been drilling and fracking wells for about 56 years now. But the reason I\\'m here kind of is this interest -- they used to call it global warming, but now it\\'s called climate change. You want to know why? The planet has cooled by 0.07 degrees in this past century, partially because of the Exxon emerging energy policies. We thank you for that.\\n\\nBut if you want to know about global warming, there\\'s a book called Unstoppable Global Warming, and it was a bestseller in The New York Times. And it tells you why we have global warming today, and we\\'ve been having it forever and ever.\\n\\nThe other item was an article that was written by, I can\\'t read my numbers here, let me (inaudible - microphone inaccessible) by Ian Pilmer (sic - Ian Plimer). He\\'s an Australian geologist, and he edits the Encyclopedia for Geology. And he came up with where does carbon dioxide really come from? A four-day volcano eruption in Iceland negated every single effort for the past five years to control CO2. Also, there was one in the Philippines in 1991. It spewed out enough greenhouse gas in a year to take care of everything that\\'s happened in our country forever and ever as far as CO2. CO2 is that vital chemical compound that every planet requires to live and grow and synthesize into oxygen for us humans and all animals to live. We need -- global warming is here and it\\'s going to be here forever. Trying to change it here the last few bits doesn\\'t make sense.\\n\\nOne quick thing about fracking. The first frac job occurred, believe it or not, in 1866. Colonel Edward Roberts got out of the military -- Civil War, and he came up with the idea of dropping gunpowder down in a wellbore where they were drilling shallow wells. And they went ahead and ignited that, and it increased the production tenfold. And we\\'ve been fracking wells for 100 years. Thanks to that, we have a lot of oil and gas. He patented that, and people didn\\'t want to pay the patent fee. So they would do it at night, and that\\'s where the word moonlighting came from. But if you all don\\'t like what you\\'re doing here, why -- I mean if you don\\'t like Exxon, why don\\'t you go ahead and sell it and buy some solar stock? And whether you\\'ll have enough money to pay for your gasoline and pay for your jet fuel that you used to come to visit here, but I recommend you vote against all of the carbon planet change proposals. Thank you.\\n\\nREX TILLERSON: Thank you. In the inside aisle here.\\n\\nRENEE BOUCHARD: Good morning. My name is [Renee Bouchard] and I\\'m actually from Texas. I live in Wimberley, Texas. Maybe you all are aware, if you watched the news a year ago yesterday, we were inundated by a flood that devastated our town. I lost our home. My family lost our home as well as 400 other homes in Wimberley were destroyed by the catastrophic flood. Needless to say, my feeling is that the effects of climate change are real and are happening now, not something that\\'s abstract and in the future, not something that\\'s just been affecting indigenous populations, even though that\\'s really heartbreaking as well. Our flood was one of five flooding-related federal disasters in Texas just in the past two years.\\n\\nI\\'ve lived in this area for over 20 years. Flooding, as you know, you\\'ll be saying: flooding happens in that part of Texas. That\\'s true, but not like this, a 40-foot wall of water, 13 inches of rain. Anyway, when these disasters happen, federal taxpayers spend billions on aid and bailouts. As you all probably are aware, State Attorneys Generals have suggested fossil fuel companies may be legally liable for these climate damages. I think from today\\'s meeting, I know what your position is and whether Exxon should be held legally liable for damages from climate change.\\n\\nSo my question is, what happens if the company loses in the coming court battles? And I anticipate there will be more. How is Exxon calculating the financial risks it would face if fossil fuel companies have to pay for damage from climate change, like the tobacco companies who, for many decades, said cigarettes were not an unhealthy thing to take part in. Thank you.\\n\\nREX TILLERSON: Speculating on future court events would be irresponsible on my part, and therefore those numbers will be unestimable. Over here.\\n\\nKATHY MULVEY, ACCOUNTABILITY CAMPAIGN MANAGER, UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS: Good morning. I\\'m Kathy Mulvey with the Union of Concerned Scientists, and I\\'m attending on the proxy of the Unitarian Universalist Association. And I have a question related to Item Nine on transparency and in climate science and policy.\\n\\nLast July, UCS published The Climate Deception Dossiers, evidence that ExxonMobil and other major fossil fuel companies have intentionally spread disinformation about climate science for decades. I have one copy here. So as state Attorneys General investigate whether ExxonMobil misled investors and the public about the realities and risks of climate change, people are increasingly making comparisons to the tobacco industry\\'s misconduct and measures taken to address it. ExxonMobil now claims that quote, \"We do not fund or support those who deny the reality of climate change.\"\\n\\nBut actions speak louder than words. ExxonMobil is represented on the board of the American Petroleum Institute, API, which continues to claim that the science of climate change is unsettled, while attempting to block efforts to limit carbon pollution. Exxon\\'s Randy Randol contributed to a notorious 1998 road map plan to sow uncertainty about climate science among the media, the public and policymakers. Other shareholders have spoken about ALEC, which was one of the organizations that API identified to bankroll that campaign. Your company sponsored ALEC\\'s 2015 annual meeting where attendees were told, \"The biggest scam of the last 100 years is global warming.\"\\n\\nMr. Tillerson, more than 26,000 UCS supporters have sent messages to you demanding that ExxonMobil stop funding ALEC as your peers, BP and Shell, have done. You\\'ve spoken this morning of commitment to integrity in everything we do. When will your company publicly condemn climate deception? And in response to the question from the Yale student, you seemed to imply perhaps not agreeing with ALEC. So what would a commitment to integrity mean in terms of separating the company from ALEC\\'s climate disinformation?\\n\\nREX TILLERSON: The only way I know to respond is to tell you that we will never withdraw our support for people to express their free-speech opinions on any matter whatsoever. And the fact that people have different opinions on climate change, they have every right to their opinion. Whether we agree with it or not, I will support their right to say so.\\n\\nKATHY MULVEY: To follow up on that, it\\'s quite clear from legal rulings that the First Amendment was never intended to protect fraud. And so clearly, there are consumer protection laws in the several federal states that are designed to present -- prevent commercial misinformation, so.\\n\\nREX TILLERSON: And we have responded to those allegations as well. They have largely been debunked. All of our publications are readily available, as you know, for examination. In fact, we donated all of those archives to the University of Texas at Austin. If we were wanting to hide something, we did a pretty poor job of it.\\n\\nLet\\'s go to the lady in the back there. No, right here, just in the middle.\\n\\nCHARLOTTE RAWLS, SHAREHOLDER: I don\\'t intend to speak and then I sit and write notes. My name is [Charlotte Rawls]. I come from Shoreacres, Texas, which is on Galveston Bay. I overlook the Baytown refinery. I watch and see what happens there daily because my window overlooks it. And what I see is a lot of smoke and a lot of flares. And then I cross the Fred Hartman Bridge and I go into Baytown, and I work with school children there. I work with school children who have much asthma -- and also in that area, heart disease and a lot of respiratory problems and cancer.\\n\\nI think it\\'s no wonder that we have one of the premier cancer institutes in Houston, MD Anderson, because we do have so much cancer in our area. When it rains, we see much more and the smells -- and definitely, it smells like toxins to me, I don\\'t know exactly what it is. I would like to see zero emissions. If we\\'re not going to admit to climate change and admit that fossil fuels are causing -- are a part of climate change, so at least let\\'s look at the health effects from the things that are coming out of the plants.\\n\\nI have experience in Baytown, but I also read about experiences about other people around the world. The other thing that happens with children is IQs are lowered when there\\'s significant amounts of air pollution, which there are in the city of Baytown.\\n\\nI do appreciate your admitting that there is climate change. I\\'ve been to several meetings. I followed ExxonMobil very closely because I\\'m a third generation shareholder. My grandfather worked for the Humble Pipe Line in -- right after World War I, and we did not buy anything, but Humble. We didn\\'t go to Shell, we didn\\'t go to Mobil, we didn\\'t go anywhere. We went to Humble. And it was not until the Exxon Valdez disaster that I started going to other places.\\n\\nI continue to have my stock and then inherited my mother\\'s stock. So I would also like to say something on behalf of my mother, which she voted every year, her proxy. And she said we need more women represented on the Board of Directors. I see a couple. I need to see more.\\n\\nThe other thing I debate often, whether I need to divest of my Exxon stock. I\\'m sorry, I still call it Exxon stock. ExxonMobil stock. It\\'s been a dilemma for me for a long time because I keep thinking that I can influence change. I\\'ve done that through the Waterkeeper Alliance. I\\'ve done that through the Natural Resources Defense Council. I\\'ve done it through Earthjustice.\\n\\nI try, I try, I try to make things better, but it\\'s about time to divest. I do benefit greatly from the stock. However, when I look to see what taxpayers are going to be paying for, I\\'m not sure it\\'s that good of a deal. Health care, and I want to go back to ALEC because we have still --\\n\\nREX TILLERSON: Could you begin to wrap it up?\\n\\nCHARLOTTE RAWLS: I\\'m sorry. I think it\\'s more expensive to own my stock than to take my dividends.\\n\\nREX TILLERSON: Thank you. So over here to this side of the hall.\\n\\nROBERT FORE, REPRESENTATIVE, PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH U.S.A.\\'S FOUNDATION: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ladies and gentlemen, members of the board and fellow shareholders. My name is Robert Fore. I\\'m here representing the shares of the Presbyterian Church U.S.A.\\'s Foundation. And as long-term shareholders, we are very concerned -- and well, very concerned about the long-term sustainability and importantly, profitability of our company.\\n\\nAnd I\\'m going to talk a little bit about the Items 11 and 12 today and talk specifically about some of the peer groups that were mentioned, peer companies and their recognition of the 2-degree scenario. Specifically, I want to talk about one, which is Saudi Aramco. Saudi Arabia has made it clear that they are seeking to monetize their oil reserves now, regardless of the impact on price.\\n\\nMinister Al-Naimi said that he could live with $20 per barrel. The Deputy Crown Prince has said $30 per barrel or $70 per barrel, it\\'s all the same to them. And he has furthermore announced plans, a plan called Vision 2030, in which he wants to wean his country off of oil by the year 2030 or sooner.\\n\\nGiven the global signals of the end of the oil era, from low commodity prices to recent statements and decisions from Saudi Aramco to start selling shares publicly to build up a $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund, we\\'re concerned about some of the claims of the future of energy will look very much like the past.\\n\\nI think you\\'ve talked a little bit today about 2040 scenarios. My question is, what do the Saudis -- or why do the Saudis see the future of oil -- future of energy so differently than the leadership of ExxonMobil? What do they know that we are not considering? Furthermore, what specifically are you doing to ensure the business model of ExxonMobil is nimble enough to withstand low carbon demand scenarios, including disruptions, be they technological regulatory or market-based?\\n\\nREX TILLERSON: Well, as to Saudi Aramco\\'s views or the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, I -- you would have to ask them. I can\\'t speak on their behalf. I think we showed you today a number of things that we\\'re doing in terms of remaining flexible to alternative outcomes in the future.\\n\\nWe have, unlike many of our competitors, we have for many years included a price of carbon in our outlook. And that price of carbon gets put into all of our economic models when we make investment decisions as well.\\n\\nIt\\'s a proxy. We don\\'t know how else to model what future policy impacts might be. But whatever policies are, ultimately they come back to either your revenues or your cost. So we choose to put it in as a cost.\\n\\nSo we have accommodated that uncertainty in the future, and everything gets tested against it. As to other actions, it\\'s the research areas you see in terms of our understanding of the issue. And we probably have been engaged in the scientific study of this longer than any of our peers for four decades now. And we continue to be engaged, so we are very, very aware and up-to-date on the current scientific understanding. And we fund a number of research areas, both academically and institutionally, that are areas where people are investigating possible breakthroughs, whether it\\'d be in battery technologies or alternative fuel technologies or what\\'s the next possible game-changing technology.\\n\\nWe do that so we\\'re aware of whether that is something that has potential or not. And so we monitor all of that, and we invest and run our programs accordingly. And should something evolve, we have the capacity to become engaged in that if we see it is in the interest of our shareholders. So that\\'s how we\\'re responding.\\n\\nSo back over here.\\n\\nHUNTER MARTIN, SHAREHOLDER: Mr. Tillerson, my name is [Hunter Martin]. My wife and I have been driving up here from Houston for more than 25 years, going back to Larry Rawl\\'s days for the meetings. And I think I bought my first shares of the company probably the year you were born. And I don\\'t presume --\\n\\nREX TILLERSON: I wish my dad had bought some shares the year I was born.\\n\\nHUNTER MARTIN: I do not presume to forecast what\\'s going to happen over the next 12 months. But [Lori] and I want to thank you and compliment you on your stewardship of our company.\\n\\nApplying whatever parameters one would choose, you personify all that is best in America and world industry, and the lives of all of us shareholders are more secure and in return, happier because of you.\\n\\nOur thanks embrace the employees as well as the board. At the top, of course, is you and your superlative guidance. Congratulations on your achievements, Mr. Tillerson, and thanks for your dedication to all of us.\\n\\nREX TILLERSON: Thank you for those kind words. Right here.\\n\\nANNA KOLINSKI: CEO Tillerson, it\\'s good to have the opportunity to speak to you. So my name is [Anna Kolinski] and my grandfather, James F. Black, was a scientist for Exxon for over 40 years. He started with Standard Oil during World War II, later earned dozens of patents for Esso and later Exxon.\\n\\nIn 1977, he briefed the company\\'s top executives on the scientific realities of climate change. He said that present thinking holds that man has a time window of 5 to 10 years before the need for hard decisions regarding changes in energy strategies might become critical. Like you acknowledge on your slides, this was over 30, almost 40 years ago. And since then, Exxon has continued to support groups that dispute the science that my grandfather warned your company about.\\n\\nMy question was going to be, will you withdraw funding from ALEC because they\\'re known to spread misinformation about climate change, but it sounds like your answer on that is a resounding no. So since you won\\'t be doing that, will Exxon be taking action to, at all, refute or counteract the negative impacts they\\'re making by funding an organization that says that climate change is a scam?\\n\\nREX TILLERSON: We will continue to engage in the policy discussions, as we currently do, with a number of broad-based groups on all sides of these issues and we\\'ll continue to be active in the discussions legislatively in Washington and elsewhere, including through the IPCC on what we think are thoughtful, sensible policy actions that accommodate both our need for economic growth as well as addressing these risks, which are going to be very, very daunting. Thank you.\\n\\n<Presentation>\\n\\nREX TILLERSON: I believe all the items of business have been covered now. So if any of you have proxy cards, please hand them to the ushers at this time. Those of you who have already returned your proxy cards need not vote by ballot unless you wish to change your votes. If you wish to change your vote, simply mark the appropriate sections of the ballot. The ballots will now be collected and turned over to the inspectors of election to be counted. If you wish your ballot to be kept secret, the ushers will provide you an envelope.\\n\\nThe appointed proxies in attendance today hereby cast all votes which we have been authorized to cast, in accordance with the instructions indicated on the individual proxy cards. So if you have proxies, please pass those to the ushers in the aisles at this time.\\n\\nSince proxies and ballots have been collected, I now declare the polls closed.\\n\\nQuestions and Answers\\n\\nREX TILLERSON: While the inspectors of election are preparing their preliminary report, I\\'m willing to answer a few more questions regarding ExxonMobil\\'s business, maybe one or two because time is running late on us. But I\\'ll interrupt at the point that the election results are available. So are there any other questions that people would like to put to me at this time? Let me go over here to someone that\\'s not spoken.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Good morning, Mr. Tillerson, directors and fellow stockholders and employees and retirees of the corporation. For many years -- I\\'m a retiree of the corporation now. But for many years, I was on boards of health care and safety for the company. For years, we were told that in health care area, we have to have a big pool for synergies and for economies of scale. But today, I understand that the pool has been split between employees\\' health care and retiree annuitant\\' health care.\\n\\nMy question to you, Mr. Tillerson, is one is why was this done because we no longer reach these economies of scale if we split the health care pool? And two is any forward comments you can make about what the future might hold for us annuitants as far as the Medicare supplement plan or any health care that the company still helps us afford? Thank you.\\n\\nREX TILLERSON: Well, I\\'m not sure I would characterize it as a splitting of the pools. We have -- obviously, we track claims and premiums in both of those pools. And so the changes you\\'ve seen are merely reflective of that experience.\\n\\nFor many, many years, the retiree pool has been subsidized by the employee pool, and it still is today. And it\\'s just a question of how much of that burden -- as we continue to bring our manning levels down within the corporation, from roughly 115,000 at the time of the ExxonMobil merger to 73,000 today. We\\'ve got a look at the cost of the plan to everyone.\\n\\nI do want to acknowledge that all of our plan participants, retirees included, have really done a very, very good job managing their health issues, which has allowed us to keep our growth in health care costs down. And so we appreciate that.\\n\\nBut the changes you\\'re seeing are really just reflective of having to bring the things back into balance. I encourage everyone to continue to take advantage of the various programs that we do provide through the company to help manage your health care. That helps us keep the cost of the program down. As you know, it\\'s a self-funded program.\\n\\nHave you got a comment down here or a question?\\n\\nJULIAN MARTINEZ, REPRESENTATIVE, SER-JOBS FOR PROGRESS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My name\\'s Julian Martinez, and I represent SER Jobs for Progress National. SER is a national, nonprofit, community-based organization serving more than 1.3 million people a year by assisting them with their employment and educational needs.\\n\\nSER National would like to thank ExxonMobil for working with us and Hispanic Heritage foundation in the past. Your efforts in sponsoring STEM programs is exemplary, and we appreciate those efforts. However, an area that we strongly believe needs improvement is your governance.\\n\\nExxonMobil has no Hispanics on their board nor on their senior management team. In order to reflect the diverse nature of the American marketplace, you need to consider making some changes.\\n\\nThe American dream is alive and well. Hispanics born in this country are more highly educated and earn higher incomes than their immigrant parents. Hispanics outpace all other Americas in forming their own businesses. They will represent fully one-third of the U.S. population in just 45 years and be an economic force of great consequence. Latino-owned businesses increased 46.9% from 2007 to 2012.\\n\\nIn 2012, 3.3 million Latino businesses had receipts totaling over $517 billion, making it 12% of our total business. Female Latino business owners were 44.4% of Latino firms as compared to 35.3% for non-Latino firms. Hispanics are the youngest racial or ethnic group in the United States. About one-third or 17.9 million of the Latino population is younger than 18, about a quarter or 14.6 million are millennials. Exxon needs to consider who both their workforce and the customers will be and embody governance and leadership to reflect that market.\\n\\nMy question, totally unrelated is, what do you think the price of oil is going to do between one and five years?\\n\\nREX TILLERSON: Well, as many of have heard me say before, if I knew that, I wouldn\\'t be here. I\\'d be on the beach with my laptop, making an oil bet every morning. So I don\\'t know is the answer to the question.\\n\\n<Presentation>\\n\\nREX TILLERSON: The inspectors of election are ready to report the preliminary vote. So may we have your report, please?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Mr. Chairman, at least 3.5 billion shares of stock of the corporation have been voted on the 14 items of business discussed at today\\'s meeting. Voting results are expressed as a percentage of total votes cast.

We appreciate you taking the time and the effort to be here. We know some of you travel a long way to be with us today, and we always enjoy seeing you, and we appreciate that you take that time. We take all of your comments seriously. It is useful to us to hear from you. And even where we disagree, I know our disagreements are both sincere on the issues as we all see them. I think we all strive for the same goals, and that\\'s to provide a great quality of life for our -- not just ourselves and our children, but people the world over. And that\\'s what the men and women of ExxonMobil are dedicated to.\\n\\nSo it\\'s great to see the shareholders that are here every year, great to see some of our [annuitants] here. Appreciate you all being here.

        "This call took place on May 25th, 2016. The transcript is over 125,000 words, nearly as long as the third Lord of the Rings book. It would be a pain to read all of it, so we'll use python to extract insights. Currently, the contents of `call[\"Text\"]` is a [\"string\"](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str)-- a sequence of characters. We can do a number of things with strings, including splitting a big string into smaller strings using a specific delimiter and the `.split()` function. For example, I can break down the whole text of the earnings call roughly into sentences by splitting the string every time I encounter a period (\".\"). This returns a list of smaller strings, and if i select the first one using `[0]`, I get the first sentence of this call:"

And I am pleased to welcome each of you that made the effort to join us today in person. I also, though, want to welcome our shareholders around the world who are joining us by way of the Internet.\\n\\nI do hope you had the opportunity to meet some of our employees in person while visiting the displays in the foyer this morning. These Exxon Mobil employees are among the over 73,000 people who are working 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year on your behalf. And many of them are working in challenging locations to deliver the energy and products needed by consumers around the world.\\n\\nThe financial and operating results that I bring to you today are really their results, and I have the privilege of presenting them to you on their behalf.\\n\\nSeated next to me is Jeff Woodbury, Vice President of Investor Relations and our Corporate Secretary. He will assist me in running the meeting today. I'll introduce the other members of the board to you a little later in the meeting.\\n\\nAs mentioned on Page 2 of the proxy statement, it is the policy of the corporation to provide confidential voting to shareholders. For shareholders who returned their proxy cards without written comments, the voted proxies have not been seen by nor reported to the corporation except in aggregate numbers. Anyone turning in a proxy card at this meeting who wishes to keep his or her votes secret, may obtain an envelope from the ushers. Proxy cards will be collected later in the meeting. A list of shareholders entitled to vote at this meeting or at any adjournment thereof is available for inspection. If anyone wishes to examine this list, an usher will be pleased to direct you to the proper location.\\n\\nShirley Nessralla and Paula Buckley of Computershare Trust Company have been appointed Inspectors of the Election for this meeting. They have taken an oath of office that has been delivered to the Secretary for filing with the minutes of the meeting. Notice of this meeting has been properly given, and the Inspectors of Election have determined that a quorum is present. There are 3.5 billion shares represented at this meeting, equating to approximately 85% of the issued and outstanding shares of stock of the corporation that are entitled to vote. I directed the inspector's written determination as to the number of shares entitled to vote at the meeting be filed with the minutes. I declare a quorum present and the meeting ready for business.\\n\\nI'd now like to explain our plan for conducting the meeting today. First, Secretary Woodbury will outline the rules of conduct and how to gain recognition. Then, I'll make some brief comments about our business results and the future we see for your company. After that, the items of business comprised of 14 proposals from the Board of Directors and shareholders will be presented. As described in the Annual Meeting program, discussion on the items of business will be deferred until all items have been presented. Time permitting, we may also have time to respond to some of the questions submitted ahead of time via proxy cards and the Internet. Upon completion of the discussion on the items of business and voting, the polls will be closed, the formal business of this year's Annual Meeting will be concluded, and the Inspectors of Election will prepare this preliminary voting report.\\n\\nWhile this is occurring, there may be time for additional comments or questions regarding our business. When the inspectors are ready, I'll ask them to give us their voting report. We will then conclude the meeting.\\n\\nShown in this slide is the list of board and shareholder proposals that will be presented and voted on this morning. The 14 items of business will be presented beginning with the election of directors, the ratification of independent auditors and the advisory vote to approve executive compensation as required by law. Then, we will continue with the 11 shareholder proposals shown in the proxy statement.\\n\\nAt this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Jeff Woodbury to discuss the rules of conduct.\\n\\n\", \"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. I'd like to take this opportunity to familiarize everyone with the safety features of the auditorium. In case of emergency, we will be notified through the public address system. Emergency exits for the ground level, as shown on the screen behind me, are situated at the rear of the auditorium, where you entered, and down in front on either side. If we do need to evacuate, please proceed to the nearest exit and the Meyerson personnel will guide you to the best way out. In addition, for safety reasons, please do not stand in aisles or in the back of the hall and do not block the exits.\\n\\nTo ensure that the meeting is conducted in the interest of all shareholders, there are certain rules of conduct governing this meeting. These rules are included in the program and shown on the screen behind me.\\n\\nLet me now just cover several of the rules. The distribution of pamphlets and other literature, banners, signs and other displays is strictly prohibited. Anyone who intentionally obstructs or interferes with this lawful meeting by physical action or verbal utterance is in violation of Texas law. Any persons engaging in such conduct will be asked to cease, and if they refuse, they will be escorted from the meeting.\\n\\nThe laws of New Jersey, where Exxon Mobil is incorporated, provide that no business can be brought up for a vote unless proper notice has been given to all shareholders. Therefore, in the fairness of other shareholders not in attendance and in keeping with the laws that govern our Annual Meeting, formal business at today's meeting is restricted to the items included in this year's proxy statement. As such, additional proposals may not be introduced on the floor.\\n\\nIn order to present a proposal, you must have checked in at the admission's desk in the lobby and verified that you are the proponent or a duly authorized proxy under New Jersey law. Presenters whose credentials have been verified will be given a blue presenter's pass. If neither the proponent nor an authorized proxy has checked in and obtained a presenter's pass, we will presume the proponent is not present, and I will move the proposal for the purposes of orderly conduct of the meeting and so that shareholder votes cast may be recorded. However, I will not be acting as a representative of the proponent. The authorized presenter of a shareholder proposal will have up to 3 minutes to present the proposal, and time may not be shared with another speaker. As the Chairman indicated, discussion on all items of business will be deferred until the discussion period later in the meeting.\\n\\nOnly shareholders as of record date or their properly appointed proxies are entitled to speak at this Annual Meeting of Exxon Mobil shareholders. Shareholders making comments during the meeting must speak or have the words translated into English so that the majority of shareholders present can understand what is being said. Comments that are offensive or otherwise inappropriate will not be permitted. Also, we ask that any issues of personal interest that's not relevant to all shareholders be raised directly with appropriate company representatives outside of the Annual Meeting. We request that individual shareholders respect the right of others to speak and keep their comments as brief as possible. As noted in the proxy statement, the Chairman has broad authority to conduct the meeting in an orderly and timely manner.\\n\\nIf you wish to make comments, you must first fill out a speaker identification card that is included in the program and was provided to you as you entered the lobby. This card confirms that you meet the requirements to speak at this meeting. Please give the completed card to the usher when you are recognized to address the meeting.\\n\\nTo ensure as many shareholders as possible who want to address the meeting today have the opportunity to do so, we ask you to follow these additional instructions. If you would like to address the meeting, move to a reserved aisle seat, remain seated, raise your hand holding your speaker identification card to indicate to the Chairman that you wish to speak. When recognized by the Chairman, give your completed speaker card to the usher, and a microphone will be provided. Please stand and begin by stating your name. You may speak for up to 2 minutes.\\n\\nNow due to the large number of items on today's agenda and a need to conclude the meeting within a reasonable period of time, we cannot assure that every shareholder who wishes to speak will be able to do so. First priority will be given to those who have not yet had an opportunity to speak.\\n\\nAs we've done in the past, we've provided a timing system with lights that will help speakers manage their time, and we'll demonstrate the system at this time.\\n\\nWhen the Chairman recognizes a speaker and a microphone has been provided by the usher, a green light will come on at the displays on both sides of the stage. The hall microphones will be activated only after the speaker has been recognized by the Chairman. When the speaker's time remaining reaches 30 seconds, a yellow light will turn on, and finally, a red light will indicate the speaker is at the end of their allowed time. And at that point, we ask you to conclude your comments.\\n\\nFinally, as we typically note at the outset of similar meetings, I would like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement that's shown on this slide. The statement contains information regarding today's presentation and discussion. You may also refer to the corporate website for additional information on factors affecting future results as well as supplementary information defining key terms that we use today throughout the meeting.\\n\\nAnd now I will turn the podium back to the Chairman to provide an overview on the business. Thank you.\\n\\n\", \"Thank you, Jeff. We will address our items of business shortly. However, first, I will share with you some financial and operating highlights from 2015, provide an update on our annual outlook for energy and review key elements of our integrated businesses. The photo you see behind me is the Antwerp refinery, one of the most efficient in Europe, where we are progressing construction of a new delayed coker. Exxon Mobil's strategy, constancy of purpose and competitive advantages continue to create superior, long-term shareholder value. Regardless of the business environment, we maintain a relentless focus on the fundamentals, those factors that we control. Our integrated business model remains resilient through the commodity price cycle. We are continuing a disciplined and paced investment approach focused on creating value while maintaining our commitment to a reliable and growing dividend.\\n\\nExxon Mobil is demonstrating differentiated performance that has become all the more visible this past year. We lead the industry in return on capital employed and most importantly, long-term shareholder returns.\\n\\nOver the next few slides, I'll highlight how we have delivered on our 2015 commitments and discuss our industry-leading performance against several key metrics. This photograph of the Deepwater Champion drilling vessel, which successfully drilled the Liza-1 exploration discovery well offshore Guyana, highlights one example of our approach to long-term resource capture and value generation. We're pleased with the initial results, and I'll discuss our plans for Guyana later in the presentation.\\n\\nSince our shareholder meeting last year, the business environment continued to deteriorate with a sharp decrease in crude oil and natural gas prices. The graphic is a stark reminder of the volatile and cyclical nature of a commodity prices business. However, the corporation is uniquely suited to endure these conditions and outperform the competition.\\n\\nRegardless of prices, we remain focused on the following business fundamentals. Operational integrity is an organizational imperative. Operating safely, reliably and effectively is the primary objective. Maximizing the reliability of our facilities, lowering cost and increasing efficiency maximizes the value of our existing asset base.\\n\\nOur integrated businesses have a distinct competitive advantage which enables us to create additional value as market conditions change. Our investment decisions are based on a long-term view informed by our energy outlook and tested across various economic parameters, including a broad range of commodity prices.\\n\\nFinally, once we decide to invest, our world-class project execution delivers a competitive, reliable asset base. These fundamentals, applied daily throughout our portfolio, deliver leading results that grow shareholder value throughout the business cycle.\\n\\n2015 results demonstrate the strength of our integrated business in a weaker commodity price environment. Our approach to business, operations and corporate citizenship is grounded in a commitment to integrity in everything we do. Nowhere is that more evident than in our commitment to safe operations. As the chart shows, our workforce safety performance for both employees and our contractors remains strong relative to the industry.\\n\\nAs to financial results, total corporate earnings were $16.2 billion with a return on capital employed of 7.9%. We generated $32.7 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales, and selectively invested $31 billion back into the business. Total shareholder distributions including dividends and share repurchases were $15 billion.\\n\\nRisk management is at the core of our business. Everything we do has an element of risk, whether technical, operational, financial, geopolitical or environmental. We have a systematic approach guided by our Operations Integrity Management System, also known as OIMS, which helps us manage safety, security, health and environmental risk.\\n\\nOIMS guides the activities of our employers and contractors to achieve excellence in our operational performance. It is a proven approach, rigorously applied to all work processes at all levels. Everyone is expected to operate in the same safe way every day, everywhere. OIMS provides appropriate emphasis on both personnel and process safety, helping us achieve superior reliability and operating performance, which ultimately leads to better business performance.\\n\\nNow let's take a look at our environmental performance. At Exxon Mobil, we recognize our dual responsibility to both expand energy supplies, but do so in a way that reflects our shared commitment to environmental stewardship. To minimize our environmental impact, we carefully identify, assess, manage and monitor potential environmental risk.\\n\\nOur comprehensive approach has continued to reduce emissions and releases, mitigating the environmental impact of our operations.\\n\\nOver the past five years, 8.8 million tons of additional greenhouse gas emissions were avoided through self-help initiatives. This is equivalent to eliminating the annual greenhouse gas emissions of nearly 2 million passenger vehicles. We're currently working at the operational level to minimize flaring and venting, and continue to implement proven reduction technologies such as selective deployment of cogeneration capacity in more than 100 installations at more than 30 locations around the world. Currently, our gross capacity for cogeneration is 5.5 gigawatts, enough to meet the annual electricity needs of 2.5 million U.S. homes. These investments have made our operations some of the most productive and energy efficient in the world.\\n\\nExxon Mobil is also a global leader in carbon capture and sequestration with working interest in more than one-third of the world's current capacity. In total, since the year 2000, we have invested nearly $7 billion in an array of technologies across the company to reduce our emissions.\\n\\nAs this chart illustrates, our approaches are broad based and targeted at delivering practical solutions in the near term and the mid-term while continuing to make long-term investments to advance emerging energy technologies on a host of frontiers.\\n\\nMost recently, we announced an expanded research program to pursue the novel application of carbonate fuel cells to capture emissions from power plants. We are in early days, but making carbon capture economic could lead to large-scale applications around the world, reducing emissions and mitigating the risk of climate change.\\n\\nExxon Mobil also continues to research potential game-changing technologies in the areas of advanced biofuels, including from algae, whole cellulosic biomass and cellulose-derived sugars, which avoid adversely affecting water use, land use or world food supplies. But to ensure investment and innovation can progress, society will need one more thing, sound public policy. Exxon Mobil has worked for decades to support and advance scientific understanding, to contribute to substantive and thoughtful policy discourse and to reach out to stakeholders and government officials at every level wherever we operate. Nowhere is this comprehensive cooperative approach more important than addressing the risk of climate change.\\n\\nFor many years now, Exxon Mobil has held the view that the risks of climate change are serious, and they do warrant thoughtful action. We have long worked collaboratively with academic and institutional efforts to support research, improve climate models and advance the scientific understanding of climate change. Our scientists have been participating with the UN's intergovernmental panel on climate change from its founding and have produced hundreds of publicly available papers including more than 50-peer-reviewed publications.\\n\\nOn the policy front, we believe that addressing the risk of climate change is a global issue, which will require the involvement of governments, companies and all energy consumers. To enable the most efficient and effective investments in lower carbon technologies, cost of carbon policies must invite and promote global participation. They must ensure a uniform and predictable cost of greenhouse gas emissions in every economy. They must allow market prices to drive the selection of solutions. They must minimize complexity and administrative cost, and maximize transparency and provide flexibility for policy adjustments in light of economic performance or new discoveries and breakthroughs in climate science. In years ahead, the world's ability to meet our shared need for energy and our shared aspirations for the environment will depend on sound policy, and that is why Exxon Mobil will continue to discuss the key principles supporting a revenue-neutral carbon tax as a possible broad-based approach.\\n\\nTurning to financial results. Exxon Mobil's return on capital employed consistently leads the competition. In 2015, our ROCE of 7.9% was significantly impacted by the drop in oil and gas prices, but was still nearly 4 percentage points higher than our nearest competitor. Over the past five years, our ROCE averaged 18% or about 5 percentage points higher than the next best competitor. Sustained leadership in capital efficiency reflects our commitment to a disciplined investment approach, strong project management and innovative technologies to grow a well-balanced portfolio across a broad range of business conditions.\\n\\nRegardless of the business environment, we strive to lead the cost curve and currently are benefiting from both ongoing efficiencies as well as cost deflation. As you can see by the graphic, we are achieving significant market savings in the current business climate. We achieved a total net reduction of $11.5 billion in both capital and cash operating cost in 2015. Our Upstream unit costs are down 9% and in refining, our unit cash costs are 15% lower than the industry average. This focus on cost leadership also reduces project cost, which improve long-term returns and free cash flow. Robust operating performance and relentless attention to cost control enable our ability to generate industry-leading free cash flow over the long term.\\n\\nExxon Mobil generated $6.5 billion of free cash flow in 2015 and almost $100 billion over the past five years, outpacing competitors. We continue to pay a reliable and growing dividend and pursue investments in attractive opportunities to create long-term shareholder value. Although the share buyback program was tapered in 2015, we maintain industry-leading distributions. On average, $0.48 of every dollar generated by the business over the last five years was distributed to you, our shareholders, while we continue to make significant investments in the business.\\n\\nWe continue to grow the dividend. The corporation's long-term dividend growth rate exceeds the S&P 500 and our industry competitors with only Exxon Mobil materially increasing the dividend in 2015, up 6.7% to $2.88 per share. And over the past 10 years from 2006 through 2015, annual dividends have increased 10% per year. We have increased our dividend 34 consecutive years including this year's second quarter increase to $0.75 per share. Our dividend payments are made with a view to building long-term shareholder value and providing a reliable dividend growth.\\n\\nShare purchases are an efficient and flexible way of returning cash to our shareholders. The corporation purchased $3 billion in 2015 and prudently tapered the program consistent with changes in the business environment and the corporation's cash requirements. Through the first half of 2016, Exxon Mobil has limited share purchases to amounts needed to offset dilution related to our benefits plans and programs. While the future pace of share purchases will reflect the market environment and cash flow at the time, we continue to regard them as a flexible method to return value to the shareholders and manage our long-term capital structure.\\n\\nSince the Exxon and Mobil merger, we have reduced total shares outstanding by 40%, including the impacts of shares we issued to purchase XTO in 2010. Over this period, total shareholder distributions including dividends were $357 billion. To put this number in perspective, these distributions to you are larger than the individual market capitalization values of 497 of the S&P 500 companies.\\n\\nNow every year, Exxon Mobil shares its long-term view of global energy demand and supply, which guides our company's business strategies and our investments, and we publish that as our outlook for energy. This document confirms the wisdom of these investments and help provide the world with reliable and affordable energy necessary to advance economic prosperity and improve living standards well into the future.\\n\\nBy the year 2040, the world's population is expected to increase from 7 billion people today to more than 9 billion people. This population growth will more than double global economic output sparking a dramatic expansion of the middle class. These fundamentals will drive energy demand growth. As a result, Exxon Mobil's 2016 outlook for energy forecasts an increase in global energy demand of about 25% during this period, even while taking into account the offsetting impact of significant energy efficiency gains.\\n\\nNon-OECD nations, shown in blue on the chart, are expected to drive growth in GDP and therefore, energy use, accounting for about 70% of global energy demand by the year 2040. The world's middle class is expected to increase by about 3 billion people, mostly from non-OECD nations. This means better living standards for billions, and it will be enabled in large part by improving access to modern technology and affordable, reliable energy. They're going to be able to buy microwaves. They're going to be able to buy refrigeration for their food and their medicines and one day, they're going to be able to buy a car. Even so, energy use per capita in developing countries will still remain below the OECD.\\n\\nThe demand outlook for OECD countries shown in red highlights the large-scale impact of energy efficiency. GDP in these countries is expected to grow about 70% between now and 2040. However, energy demand is likely to remain essentially flat as expanded use of energy-efficient technologies and practices lead to significant energy savings. Without these efficiency gains, we estimate global demand growth would be about four times our projected 25%.\\n\\nFinally, I'll note, our energy outlook assumptions are consistent with the aggregation of Paris climate agreement commitments.\\n\\nSo now we'll move to discussion of energy supplies needed to meet this growing demand. As the world's population grows and living standards improve, we expect to see an evolving energy landscape, driven by advances in technology, available resources and trade. Together, oil and natural gas will meet about 60% of global demand in the year 2040, about the same percentage as they do today, and will lead growth even though the energy mix evolves.\\n\\nWe expect oil will remain the leading energy source as it remains essential to meet growing needs for transportation and as a feedstock for petrochemicals. Natural gas is abundant and well suited to meet rising power generation and industrial needs, while also providing a cost-effective option to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Natural gas demand will increase more than any other energy type, surpassing coal to become the second-largest source, in part driven by a tripling of global liquefied natural gas demand across this period.\\n\\nThe outlook anticipates that stringent government policies will increase the cost of CO2 emissions over time. These policies will incentivize the growth of energy types with low-carbon intensity, including natural gas, nuclear, solar and wind.\\n\\nOur view is grounded in the reality that abundant energy supplies are vital to modern life. Greater access to affordable and reliable energy will remain fundamental to reducing poverty and advancing standards of living for billions of people around the world.\\n\\nTo sustain progress and further expand prosperity, the world must increase the availability of affordable energy solutions. Therefore, meeting the growth in global energy demand will require diverse energy supplies from conventional and unconventional oil and gas, as well as liquefied natural gas and nuclear and renewables. We should pursue all economic opportunities.\\n\\nFortunately, technology advances continue to expand our energy options while helping to minimize our environmental footprint. Continued access to high-quality resources and substantial investments will remain fundamental in meeting these challenges. And free markets, supported by sound and reliable public policies, remain vital to the development of new energy supplies. This includes policies that promote free and open trade, and encourage private sector investments.\\n\\nSo now I'll provide a business and operational update. Shown here is the Upper Zakum development, offshore Abu Dhabi, which utilizes our innovative approach of creating four artificial islands to maximize economic recovery from this very large field. Exxon Mobil, along with our partners, developed the island drilling concept, which has significantly reduced total development cost. Exxon Mobil provides industry leadership to meet the world's energy needs. Key elements of our strategy are shown on this chart. Our approach has been consistent for decades, and through systematic implementation and continuous improvement, these elements have become resilient, competitive advantages.\\n\\nRisk management and operational excellence are at the very core of our business activities. Investment and cost discipline, along with world-class project execution result in the best asset mix in the industry. We continuously seek to high grade our portfolio beyond our exploration program through accretive acquisitions, restructurings and asset sales.\\n\\nAs I'll discuss in the coming slides, we capture significant value-added benefits from our vertical integration. Our long-standing commitment to technology leadership stimulates innovation and provides unique advantages. And our high-performing workforce drives premier results across our businesses. Our employees are the best of the best, and their dedication produces the results that I share with you today. In short, we are delivering on our commitments and achieving differentiated performance to meet our objective of growing shareholder value.\\n\\nThe level of Exxon Mobil's business integration is a sustainable, competitive advantage that is difficult to replicate, and we continue to increase that level of integration. Our businesses work together across the value chain to share knowledge, insights and best practices. This collaboration leads to better informed decisions, more efficient operations and higher quality investments, delivering unique value and resiliency. Our diverse asset base provides market optionality and operational flexibility to optimize value every step of the way from the wellhead all the way to the consumer. This structural advantage drives our differentiated financial strength and our superior results.\\n\\nAs I mentioned earlier, Exxon Mobil maintains a disciplined and paced investment approach, focused on creating long-term value. In 2016, we expect to spend around $23 billion or $8 billion less than in 2015. This plan reflects lower upstream project spending as we continue to bring major projects to completion and into production. Downstream and chemical plants reflect unique opportunities to grow and strengthen those businesses. We anticipate the 2017 budget will be less than $23 billion. We have a flexible, high-quality opportunity set and have the capability to increase the investment program based on market demand fundamentals or adjust future spending lower should conditions warrant. By selectively investing through the cycle, we remain positioned to capture market efficiencies and savings to deliver better financial returns.\\n\\nWe remain steadfast in our objective to create superior long-term value. Our planned deliverables are summarized on this chart. We manage the business to achieve industry-leading returns throughout the commodity price cycle. We work to maximize value chain benefits across the integrated portfolio, adjusting to changing product demand and improving the portfolio mix.\\n\\nCapital discipline remains paramount to our continued success. We've paced the investment program selectively, investing in attractive opportunities while maintaining our flexibility to adjust.\\n\\nUpstream volumes are an outcome of the investment program, and we anticipate a range of 4.0 million to 4.2 million oil equivalent barrels per day of production through the year 2020.\\n\\nCash flow is expected to grow from new investments, continued operating excellence, reduced spending and self-help initiatives, and we continue to share the corporation's success with our shareholders. Distributions are made with a view to building long-term value by providing a reliable and growing dividend.\\n\\nNext, I'll review our Upstream business. Exxon Mobil has a high-quality, diverse portfolio of assets, with oil and natural gas producing activities in 24 countries. Currently, we're producing 2.3 million barrels per day of liquids and 10.5 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas. This base of operations provides long-term cash flow and the capability to progress attractive new opportunities through the cycle to meet long-term energy demand.\\n\\nWe have an extensive portfolio of approximately 100 capital projects to develop over 20 billion oil equivalent barrels, providing us multiple options that enable selective and paced investment. These projects are at varying stages of advancement, including those that are already under construction like the Odoptu Stage 2 project in Sakhalin, Russia; projects in the engineering design stage, such as the Tengiz Expansion project in Kazakhstan; and opportunities where we're evaluating concepts to expand development around existing infrastructure, such as deepwater tiebacks offshore West Africa.\\n\\nWe have an unmatched opportunity base across multiple resource types, including both short and longer cycle opportunities that provide investment flexibility. Let's talk about some of our recent startups. Projects that started up in 2015 added 300,000 oil equivalent barrels per day of working interest capacity. In West Africa -- in the deepwater, we added 70,000 oil equivalent barrels per day of working interest capacity with two capital-efficient projects that leveraged on existing infrastructure, the Erha North Phase 2 project in Nigeria and Kizomba Satellites Phase 2, offshore Angola. Both of these projects started up ahead of schedule and below budget. The Kearl expansion project started up five months ahead of schedule. The project incorporated learnings from the initial development phase and doubled Kearl's production capacity to 230,000 barrels per day. In Indonesia, the Banyu Urip project added 75,000 barrels per day of working interest capacity. Production has now successfully ramped up to full capacity at 185,000 barrels per day.\\n\\nMoving on to 2016, 2017 startups. 10 projects are scheduled to be completed this year and next, adding more than 450,000 oil equivalent barrels per day of working interest capacity. These projects highlight the geographic resource diversity of our portfolio. As you can see, the locations range from North America to Russia, from Australia to the Middle East. Also consistent with energy demand growth projections, we are investing across several resource types, including liquefied natural gas, deepwater developments, conventional and the Arctic. We're making great progress with these major construction projects with four of them starting up already this year.\\n\\nWe also have an attractive domestic onshore resource base. Our U.S. unconventional resource base is over 15 billion oil equivalent barrels. We continue to focus on liquids growth mainly through development in the Permian Basin and the Bakken plays with 2.1 million net acres and current net production of 230,000 barrels per day. In 2015, we increased our net Permian and Bakken production nearly 25%. The Permian unconventional production component nearly doubled as we increased horizontal drilling in the Wolfcamp formation in the Midland Basin.\\n\\nAdditionally, we continue to improve our acreage position through trades and farm-ins. We operate over 80% of our U.S. unconventional assets. Our ownership and operating position enable flexible development consistent with the business environment. As such, we've reduced our rig count over 70% from the peak 2015 levels while remaining positioned to adjust those levels up or down further depending on the market conditions.\\n\\nTurning to our exploration portfolio. As shown on the map, we're pursuing a diverse set of high potential resource opportunities, which could add to our resource base. We hold more than 110 million net acres from under-explored regions with higher risk, but higher reward potential, to more established lower-risk basins close to existing infrastructure. We recently captured 10 new opportunities covering over 2 million net acres, gaining exposure to multiple plays in established areas as well as new emerging basins. The yellow stars marked the eight discoveries we made in 2015. We added 1.4 billion oil equivalent net barrels to our resource base, including the Liza exploration well, offshore Guyana, which was the largest oil discovery by industry in 2015. Additional resource was also added in Iraq, Nigeria, Romania, Australia and onshore North America.\\n\\nWe've accumulated an attractive position offshore Guyana, a new area with very large resource potential. We recently acquired an operating interest in the Canje Block adjacent to our existing Stabroek Block. This brings our total position to 8.1 million gross acres. To put this in perspective, this is the equivalent of 1,400 Gulf of Mexico blocks.\\n\\nFollowing the Liza-1 discovery, we completed the largest proprietary 3-dimensional seismic survey in our company's history and have initiated a multi-well exploration and appraisal drilling campaign, with the spud of the Liza-2 well in February of this year. The data from this appraisal well and the 3D seismic will be used to further our understanding of the block's potential and possible development concepts.\\n\\nLet's now take a look at our Downstream and Chemical business. As the points on the map indicate, we have refining and petrochemicals manufacturing assets in all major regions of the world, supporting the marketing of our products in more than 130 countries. Our scale, integration and balanced portfolio of assets in fuels, lubricants and chemicals provide opportunities to capture the highest value for each molecule, while also capturing operating efficiencies.\\n\\nTo further grow the value of these businesses, we are progressing a diverse portfolio of attractive investments. Consistent with our strategy, these investments capitalize on several value chain opportunities, which include increasing feedstock and logistics flexibility.\\n\\nTo highlight a few projects underway, we are increasing our sour crude oil processing capability in Baton Rouge, Louisiana by expanding sulfur handling capacity by 40%, while also implementing steps to improve access to a broad range of North American crude oils.\\n\\nAt our refinery in Beaumont, Texas, we're expanding capacity to run attractive light crude oils by 20,000 barrels per day. In chemicals, we are constructing a multibillion-dollar ethane steam cracker and associated polyethylene facilities in Texas, to capitalize on low-cost North American feedstock. When completed, these facilities will be among the world's most competitive petrochemical projects through scale and integration with existing manufacturing facilities and production of premium metallocene polyethylene.\\n\\nAs mentioned earlier, at the Antwerp refinery in Belgium, we're constructing a 50,000-barrel per day delayed coker to upgrade low-value bunker fuel oil currently produced at our Northern European refineries into higher value low sulfur -- ultra-low sulfur diesel.\\n\\nAt the Rotterdam refinery in the Netherlands, we are expanding the hydrocracking unit to upgrade low-value hydrocarbons into premium lube base stocks and ultra-low sulfur diesel, positioning ExxonMobil as the first large-scale producer of Group 2 base stocks in Europe.\\n\\nAt our Fawley refinery in the United Kingdom and our refinery in Singapore, we are making investments to debottleneck existing units, allowing us to upgrade distillate streams into higher value chemical intermediate products.\\n\\nEach of these projects target our most competitive strategic assets. We are also making selective investments in our lubes and chemical value chains to increase production of specialty products. We're currently commissioning a specialty elastomers facility in Saudi Arabia to produce synthetic rubbers, polyolefin elastomers and carbon black to serve the auto industry.\\n\\nIn Singapore, we are expanding finished lubricant manufacturing capacity to support rapidly growing sales of our industry-leading synthetic lubricant products such as Mobil 1. Also in Singapore, construction is underway on a world scale facility to produce premium synthetic rubber for the growing tire market and premium resins for adhesive applications. These investments will strengthen ExxonMobil's leading global positions in these high-growth products.\\n\\nOur direct interface with consumers is largely through our brands such as Esso, Exxon, Mobil and Mobil 1. Our broad product offering is supported by quality and reliability along with technology development, which enables us to bring new high performance products to market and further grow our brands.\\n\\nOver the past decade, we have more than doubled sales of synthetic lubricants including Mobil 1, Mobil Delvac 1 and a Mobil SHC. We've increased branded retail fuel sales by expanding our network to more than 20,000 Exxon, Mobil and Esso branded stations along with providing innovative brand marketing and technology programs to deliver a superior customer offering.\\n\\nI'll conclude the business and operational update with a photo of construction under way at our world scale Baytown refining and petrochemical complex, one of the investments I described earlier. These major investment programs, whether they are new country entries or expansions of existing and legacy locations, can only succeed if we also invest in the communities where we live and work. The people of ExxonMobil understand and take seriously our responsibilities to shareholders, to communities, our neighbors and our customers to be responsible corporate citizens and to operate with the highest standards of ethical behavior. Safety and environmental protection are more than just a priority at ExxonMobil, they are core values, an integral part of our culture and fundamental to the success of our business.\\n\\nAs we develop oil and gas resources to meet the world's growing energy needs, we must do so in a manner that contributes to the economic and social development of the communities in which we operate. Our efforts are directed at employing and training local workforces, supporting local suppliers and service providers and improving the livelihoods of the community members.\\n\\nWe continue to make substantial progress in training and hiring host country workers, which advances local economic development and education. For example, in Chad, 94% of our personnel are citizens of that country, and 72% of supervisory roles are held by locals. We make strategic investments to support needs of local communities. In 2015, we contributed $268 million to community initiatives around the world. Our education initiatives include programs supporting both students and teachers that encourage pursuit of careers in science, technology, engineering and math.\\n\\nFor 15 years, we have been a leader in the fight to combat preventable and treatable illnesses like malaria. To date, the antimalarial programs we have funded have reached more than 125 million people. Our support has helped train more than 520,000 health workers as well as distribute 3.8 million doses of antimalarial treatments and almost 14 million bed nets.\\n\\nWe've learned that empowering women economically is essential to local development. Through ExxonMobil's women's economic opportunity initiative, we invest in programs to develop the next generation of female entrepreneurs and business leaders. Through these programs, we provide the skills, resources and access to technology needed to increase their productivity and their income.\\n\\nAnd our people give not only of their personal treasure, but also their time through volunteering. Nearly 15,000 Exxon employees -- ExxonMobil employees, retirees and their families donated more than 629,000 hours to almost 5,000 charitable organizations in 34 countries around the world. It is not a slogan, but a fact. Where ExxonMobil people go, good things happen in those communities.\\n\\nIn highly capital-intensive industries such as ours, financial results and stock market returns are best viewed over a long time horizon. The energy industry requires sustainable risk management of the physical assets as well as the cash and the capital and long cycle times for investments to deliver results. ExxonMobil has generated greater shareholder returns than the average of our competitors over the last 5-, 10- and 20-year periods. These superior returns reflect our sustained financial and operating advantages that position us to maximize shareholder value.\\n\\nI want to leave you with a few personal thoughts about our company and its meaningful contributions to society. We are delivering on our business commitments in creating long-term shareholder value. Our talented, dedicated workforce drives premier results, providing reliable, affordable energy to advance human progress the world over.\\n\\nExxonMobil is more than an energy company. We're making a significant difference in our communities, creating economic opportunities and improving lives by investing in better education, health care and infrastructure. We are pioneering science and advancing technologies to improve energy efficiency, reduce emissions and expand the sources of energy. We've taken thoughtful consistent action to protect the environment and to help understand and reduce the risk of climate change. I'm certainly proud of our employees. Who we are, what we do every day to provide energy the world needs while supporting our communities and improving the lives of people the world over.\\n\\nNow before we continue with our planned agenda items, I want to share with you a brief video that illustrates some of these meaningful contributions.\\n\\n(video playing)\\n\\n\", \"So now, turning to the formal business of the meeting and a few brief remarks on shareholder proposals and voting. Each year, the corporation receives a number of suggestions from shareholders. Some of these are in the form of proposals to be presented at the Annual Meeting and each is given careful consideration.\\n\\nWe seek dialogues with the sponsors prior to the meeting when there is more time to better understand each other's positions and we often find agreement. Let me be clear on the conduct of the meeting. Recognizing that the majority of our shareholders have voted by proxy and are not present, we have established procedures to facilitate an orderly meeting.\\n\\nWe've set up a process for speakers to identify themselves and to express their views and I assure you, we welcome those views. In order that as many shareholders as possible can participate, we have set time limits and a system of reminders to help you manage your time.\\n\\nWe have 14 items to consider. As Secretary Woodberry said earlier, discussion on all items of business will be deferred to the discussion period. This may enable us to have some time for general comments and questions as well and conclude the meeting in a reasonable time frame.\\n\\nFor those of you who may wish to leave the meeting at any time, let me express my appreciation for your attendance. Since we have a number of items yet to discuss on the program and you've been sitting for a while, I would invite you to stand and take a short stretch break and I would ask that you not leave the hall. We'll resume in just a moment.\\n\\n(Break)\\n\\n\", \"If you'd please take your seats. The first item of business is the election of 14 directors. I nominate the 14 persons identified on Pages 16 through 20 of the proxy statement. These 14 people are highly qualified to serve on the Board.\\n\\nAll of our nominees are currently serving as ExxonMobil directors, except for [Ms. Braly], who has been nominated by the Board for first election as a director today. All director nominees are in attendance today with the exception of Jay Fishman who was unable to attend, although I know Jay has dialed in on the Internet to the meeting.\\n\\nNow I'd like to ask the nominees seated to my right in the orchestra terrace to be recognized as their names are called and then I'll close the nominations. Michael Boskin, Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, Angela Braly, Ursula Burns, Larry Faulkner, Henrietta Fore, Kenneth Frazier, Douglas Oberhelman, Sam Palmisano, Steve Reinemund, William Weldon and Darren Woods.\\n\\nI declare the polls open for all who want to vote in the election of directors and the 13 remaining items. If you wish to change your proxy instructions on the election of directors or any other of the 13 items or if you have not submitted a proxy and wish to vote by ballot, they are available from the ushers.\\n\\nPlease raise your hand if you would like a ballot at any time during the formal business. They will be collected after all items have been discussed.\\n\\nThe next item on the agenda is the ratification of PricewaterhouseCoopers as the independent auditors. The Audit Committee of the Board has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers to audit ExxonMobil's financial statements for 2016, and we are asking shareholders to ratify that appointment.\\n\\nPricewaterhouseCoopers is represented today by Mr. Alan Page. Alan, would you please stand? Thank you.\\n\\nThe Audit Committee's reasons for recommending PricewaterhouseCoopers appear in the proxy statement. I move the adoption of the proposal shown on Pages 24 and 25 of the proxy statement.\\n\\nThe next order of business is consideration of the Board-sponsored proposal regarding Executive compensation. This board proposal calls for shareholder advisory vote to approve Executive compensation as required by law. The Board recommends a vote for this proposal, as outlined on Pages 26 and 27 of the proxy statement.\\n\\nThe next order of business is consideration of the 11 shareholder proposals in the proxy statement. The first shareholder proposal regarding an independent chairman is shown on Pages 56 and 57 of the proxy statement. I understand that Beth Richtman will present the proposal. Beth, are you here? Yes.\\n\\n\", \"Good morning. Mr. Secretary, Chair, members of the Board and fellow shareholders. My name is Beth Richtman. I am an investment manager at CalPERS, the largest U.S. pension fund, with approximately $300 billion under management.\\n\\nCalPERS is a long-term owner with 13 million shares of ExxonMobil worth over $1 billion. I'm here to present Proposal Number four, which calls on Exxon to separate the positions of chair and CEO in the transition to the next CEO on behalf of the Ellen Higgins Trust.\\n\\nCalPERS firmly believes that companies with good corporate governance and sustainable business practices will outperform over the long term. In our view, a separate independent chair and CEO structure eliminates the conflicts of interest, which arise when the CEO is also responsible for board oversight. It's like grading your own exam papers when you have a chair who effectively oversees the CEO.\\n\\nWith the announced retirement of Mr. Tillerson, we think it's an excellent time to review Exxon's leadership structure and improve the governance by separating the chair and CEO roles.\\n\\nNow is a time of great change, great risk and great opportunity for Exxon and the energy sector. Many other governments -- many other companies, large shareowners and governments all agree that the COP21 Paris agreement sets us on a path towards a low-carbon economy.\\n\\nIt is widely recognized that chairing the Board is a very time-intensive job. Having a separate chair would provide more time for Exxon's CEO to focus on running the company and the Board to focus on oversight in this time of unprecedented change for the company and the energy sector.\\n\\nWith an improved governance structure and improved focus and time commitments for the key leaders at Exxon, we would also expect improved disclosure to shareowners on how Exxon is analyzing and preparing for the transition to the low-carbon economy.\\n\\nCalPERS appreciates this opportunity to address the Board directly. We think that it is unfortunate that Exxon's current policy prevents the Board from having a dialogue with shareowners.\\n\\nEngagement between shareowners and directors leads to the type of productive discussion of long-term strategic issues that can prevent the necessity of shareholder proposals and proxy battles. We're hopeful Exxon will end this policy of preventing these important conversations with your shareowners.\\n\\nIn closing, please join CalPERS and vote for Proposal Number four to separate the CEO and chair roles and bring our company into the realm of best practice. Because accountability and transparency are the key tenets of good governance, CalPERS has also been actively soliciting with The New York City Comptroller's office for Proposal Number seven concerning proxy access and Proposal Number 12 to improve the company's risk reporting concerning climate change risk. Combined, these proposals will set Exxon on a future course for success. As long-term owners and as fiduciaries, we ask for nothing less. Thank you.\\n\\n\", \"Thank you. The Board recommends a vote against this proposal, as outlined on Page 57 of the proxy statement.\\n\\nThe next shareholder proposal calls for the addition of a climate expert to the Board and as shown on Page 58 of the proxy statement. I understand Fr. Michael Crosby will present the proposal. Fr. Crosby?\\n\\n\", \"Good morning, Mr. Tillerson and Board members and fellow shareholders. As Mr. Tillerson said, I am Michael Crosby. I'm a Capuchin Franciscan friar priest from Milwaukee. So I move our resolution. We're asking for a person with climate change expertise to be on the Board for two main reasons.\\n\\nAs many of you know, ExxonMobil doesn't allow its shareholders to have access to the Board, as a whole, or any of its members to discuss these issues independent of management. But the other reason, if you would look at Pages 6 to 8, is according to the references for the Board members, which are substantial, not one person has any expertise on climate.\\n\\nAnd as a result, the Board is only able to address the issue given what management says. It notes the fact that 12 members have global business credentials, that five members have financial expertise, one has some credentials in chemistry, but management's own list has nobody identified with climate risk. And this is the biggest risk facing the company's business, not to mention everybody on the planet. Maybe if we would have had a climate change expert on the Board, she or he would not have allowed Exxon to act in the way they did when we first filed our shareholder resolution in 1997 on climate change or maybe they wouldn't have denied it for the first 10 years after we did file it.\\n\\nEven as I speak today, the company is still supporting efforts, it seems, by some to undermine state's efforts to ensure the health of their people by having some kind of mitigation around climate change.\\n\\nToday, at the meeting, we heard from CalPERS and CalPERS just issued a statement that from now on, they're going to be asking all companies to have somebody with climate change on their board. If that's going to be for all companies, how much more for a company where almost 100% of our product and our efforts and production is related to climate change.\\n\\nI'd like to compliment you on the way you began your remarks. I think it's the first time, and you know I've been here quite a bit, where you begin with the problem of climate change and acknowledged it. But at this stockholders meeting, with more press participating than ever, ExxonMobil has a chance to restore the public's trust. This calls for conversion. I like the kiosk out there that talked about the drone and we can create disruptive change, you said.\\n\\nWe don't want disruptive change. We want constructive change and this conversion invites us to change. As a Catholic priest, I join Pope Francis in believing that conversion is possible to more and more efforts around renewables. And so as a result of that, I urge support for our resolution. Thank you.\\n\\n\", \"Thank you, Fr. Crosby. The Board recommends a vote against this proposal, as outlined on Pages 58 and 59 of the proxy statement.\\n\\nThe next shareholder proposal, to hire an investment bank as shown on Page 59 of the proxy statement. I understand that Tracey Rembert will present the proposal. Ms. Rembert?\\n\\n\", \"Thank you, fellow shareholders, Mr. Tillerson and the Board. My name is Tracey Rembert and I'm here representing Christian Brothers Investment Services, which is a Catholic investment manager with over $6 billion in assets under management. We've been a longtime shareholder of ExxonMobil with over 329,000 shares currently, and we want to formally move Item Number Six, Ken Steiner's proposal on hiring an investment bank to break up the company.\\n\\nWhile we don't agree with this proposal, we are moving it as a formal courtesy to a fellow shareholder. We do think it -- we're at an interesting time in discussion of the company and its current business model. But we haven't given up on ExxonMobil just yet. We think that you can be prepared for a diversified energy future, but we can't keep having these conversations year-over-year. I think in terms of action that's needed, solutions that need to come to the table, I really hope I'm not here 10 years from now having the same conversations and the company has dramatically started to address some of the issues raised.\\n\\nI'm here to talk about impact on the world's poor, and issues continue to circle around the company about the nimbleness of your current business model to be able to address issues. Exxon presents a false choice between providing reliable and affordable energy and addressing climate change. We don't think it's an either/or. We think right now, absolutely, both issues need to be addressed. Impacts the world's poorest communities, including those in the global South, are happening now. Climate change is not some abstract thing likely to happen 80 or 100 years from now. It is here, and it is visceral, and it's devastating the world's poor people, and Exxon has said for over a decade that it wants to provide affordable energy to the world's poor, but only through business as usual measures, but we expect more.\\n\\nWe question whether lives will actually be improved in low-income communities if they are regularly suffering from the impacts of drought, extreme weather, geopolitical upheaval due to climate change and other factors. We want to hear from our company how you will begin to address these impacts that are a consequence of your core products and current business model.\\n\\nThis is not about \\\"abundant energy supply\\\" as you just mentioned in some of your remarks earlier. This is about abundant ultra-low carbon energy supply for the masses that want energy. This is what is needed.\\n\\nWe currently question whether ExxonMobil long term will do more harm than good with its current business strategy. And, therefore, we really urge you, Mr. Tillerson, especially the Board, as new leadership comes in, it's now or never.\\n\\nThe impacts to the world's poor -- we've far surpassed, I think, the point where people are suffering and we'd really like to see Exxon bring some viable solution to the table, not just talking about small investments in an energy transition. We do want to see Exxon actually steer us to a low-carbon path. Thank you.\\n\\n\", \"Thank you, Ms. Rembert. The Board recommends a vote against this proposal, as outlined on Page 59 of the proxy statement.\\n\\nThe next shareholder proposal for a proxy access bylaw is shown on Page 59 and 60 of the proxy statement. I understand that Michael Garland will present the proposal. Mr. Garland?\\n\\n\", \"Good morning Mr. Chairman, members of the board and fellow shareowners. I'm with the office of New York City Comptroller, Scott Stringer, and I'm presenting Proposal Seven on behalf of The New York City Pension Funds.\\n\\nThese funds have $160 billion in assets and are substantial, long-term ExxonMobil shareowners. We're voting 10.5 million shares at today's meeting valued at nearly $1 billion and this represents the retirement security for New York City's teachers, firefighters, police and other loyal city employees.\\n\\nProposal seven calls for a proxy access bylaw to enable shareowners that have collectively held at least 3% of the company for three years to include a limited number of director candidates on the company ballot.\\n\\nThe proposed bylaw is intended to give substantial long-term shareowners a meaningful voice in electing the directors responsible for overseeing the company's long-term strategy and risks, including risks related to climate change.\\n\\nProxy access will enable Exxon shareowners to ensure that the Board is made up of independent and accountable directors who have the diverse mix of relevant skills, experience and perspectives necessary to navigate these challenges and create long-term shareowner value.\\n\\nThe proposed bylaw includes appropriate safeguards to prevent abuse, a 3% interest in Exxon is currently valued at over $11 billion. By any measure, a significant stake in the company's future. There've been extraordinary developments since last year's Annual Meeting when the proposal received 49% of votes cast and these highlight why this is a defining moment for the board and why proxy access is so important for Exxon shareowners.\\n\\nOxford University released a study that found that major oil companies face significant risks from groupthink because they make large lumpy investments with long time horizons. The study found that Exxon had the least diverse board, particularly with respect to age range, nationality and industry experience among the six largest oil and gas companies in the world, publicly traded, and was therefore most exposed to risks of groupthink.\\n\\n175 companies -- 175 countries signed the Paris agreement, demonstrating that there's global political will to limit carbon emissions, a scenario the Board must take more seriously.\\n\\nThe Saudi government announced dramatic steps to prepare its economy for the inevitability of a low-carbon future. Major oil companies like BP and Shell have supported shareowner requests for climate risk reporting similar to Proposal 12, which The New York City funds have joined with CalPERS to actively support along with proxy access.\\n\\nFinally, since last year's meeting, more than 200 U.S. companies have enacted proxy access bylaws on terms similar to Proposal Seven. They include the largest U.S. oil companies other than Exxon. They include seven companies at which Exxon directors also serve as directors.\\n\\nMany of these companies have voluntarily enacted proxy access without the need for a vote, including more than 70% of the 72 companies that received proposals from New York City this year.\\n\\nExxon's board is an outlier in its continuing opposition to proxy access, the climate risk reporting and to engaging directly with shareowners. It's time for the board to demonstrate its commitment to an accountable system of corporate governance that fosters long-term value creation.\\n\\nWe urge shareowners to vote for Proposal Seven. Thank you.\\n\\n\", \"Thank you, Mr. Garland. The Board recommends a vote against this proposal, as outlined on Pages 60 and 61 of the proxy statement.\\n\\nThe next shareholder proposal calls for a report on compensation for women and is shown on Pages 61 and 62 of the proxy statement. I understand that Tom Sifferman will present this proposal.\\n\\n\", \"Thank you, sir. It's good to be back here again, Chairman. The Board of Directors, shareholders, this is my second time presenting this. My name is Tom Sifferman as indicated. I'm a Ph. D. and Registered/Licensed Professional Engineer and speaking on behalf of Eve Sprunt, my former coworker at Mobil Oil. She's a Ph. D.\\n\\nI have eight bullet items, most of it it's in the proxy statement, but one thing I wanted to say is that there is no doubt that Exxon from ExxonMobil's statement in the proxy that they are attempting to help women advance.\\n\\nThe question is how effective those actions have been? Subtle and subconscious prejudice is difficult to combat as a major factor for women's underrepresentation in leadership roles. The value that is placed one someone's role within a company is reflected in their monetary compensation.\\n\\nWomen in management and executive ranks are often underrepresented and support functions that are less well compensated instead. The results of ExxonMobil's actions are -- if they are so good, please show us the money, that's the important thing, provide data on how women's compensation compares with men's at all levels. The Bureau of Statistics and Labor reports that 76% of human resource managers are female, but on the average, their pay is only 71% of their male counterparts. If human resource managers, who are the company's watchdogs can't take care of themselves, who can?\\n\\nThe proof of how successful the efforts are is in the money. Again, show us the money. We need to see the data. If, and that's a question if, if ExxonMobil is a leader in advancing women the compensation data should be a valuable recruiting tool to attract the best and brightest women, let's use it for our advantage. As shareholders, we want ExxonMobil to succeed in advancing women to attract and retain the most advanced, most talented and productive women.\\n\\nWomen also invest money in different funds and fund managers now days don't seem to be too concerned about sending female investors a message that there should be pay transparency. Basically, show us the money. Thank you very much.\\n\\n\", \"Thank you, Mr. Sifferman. The Board recommends a vote against this proposal, as outlined on Pages 62 and 63 of the proxy statement.\\n\\nThe next shareholder proposal calls for a report on lobbying and is shown on Pages 63 and 64 of the proxy statement. I understand that Hughes Jenkins will present the proposal. Mr. Jenkins?\\n\\n\", \"Fellow shareholders and members of the board, my name is Hughes Jenkins, and I'm a nine-year employee at ExxonMobil in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. On behalf of the United Steelworkers and (inaudible) followers, I hereby move Item Nine. The proposal asking our company to provide a report on state and federal lobbying expenditures including indirect funding of lobbying through trade associations and support for the American Legislative Exchange Council known as ALEC.\\n\\nIllustrating the deep international concern about lobbying and climate change, AP7, a Swedish pension fund, which owns over 3.4 million shares joined as a co-filer this year. Transparency and accountability in corporate spending to influence public policy are the best -- are in the best interest of ExxonMobil shareholders, and a high profile investigation into whether our company mislead investors on climate change only underscores the importance of full disclosure.\\n\\nCorporations contribute millions of dollars to trade associations, they're directly -- they lobby indirectly on their behalf without specific disclosure or accountability. ExxonMobil does not even disclose its trade association membership nor the portions of these payments used for lobbying, so shareholders currently have no way to know how much ExxonMobil's trade association contributions are being used to lobby on its behalf.\\n\\nExxonMobil also contributes to tax-exempt organizations [their] right and endorse model state legislation playing a key role in ALEC. ALEC has attracted negative attention for its role in promoting bills on anti-immigration policies, and also blocking EPA regulation on climate change. ALEC also promotes legislation that seeks to diminish workers' rights in our country. As a proud member of the United Steelworkers Union, I find many of ALEC's proposed laws to be distasteful.\\n\\nThis is one of the reasons why we are seeking full disclosure on lobbying. Our company argument against Item Nine suggests shareholders can use government (inaudible) to get this information, but public information does not provide a clear picture of ExxonMobil's lobbying expenditures, nor is it easy to assess.\\n\\nWe urge shareholders to vote for this proposal to mandate our company supply this important report. Thank you.\\n\\n\", \"Thank you, Mr. Jenkins. The Board recommends a vote against this proposal, as outlined on pages 64 and the 65 of the proxy statement.\\n\\nThe next proposal calls for a commitment to increase the total amount authorized for capital distributions and is shown on Page 65 and 66 of the proxy statement. I understand that [Natasha Lamb], will present the proposal. Ms. Lamb?\\n\\n\", \"Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the Board and fellow shareholders. My name is Natasha Lamb, and I am here on behalf of Arjuna Capital and Baldwin Brothers' client Eric MacCallum to move Proposal Number 10, which asks our company to prioritize profitability and value over growth by returning more capital to shareholders.\\n\\nWe ask this in light of increasingly risky investments in potentially stranded carbon assets. That is carbon assets we can't burn without irreversible climate disruption. Implementing the proposal would represent a prudent, albeit, disciplined path forward in the face of unburnable carbon assets, which represent approximately two-thirds of proven global reserves according to the International Energy Agency.\\n\\nThese reserves cannot be burned when the Paris Climate Agreement established by 196 countries to prevent a less than 2 degrees Celsius rise in global temperature goes into effect. For a while, the business plan of extracting as much carbon as quickly as possible was a winner, last century, that same plan will destroy value this century and already has. Historic levels of capital spend on growth assets has eroded profitability and Exxon's risk profile, return on equity and return on invested capital are at historic lows.\\n\\nProfitability has fallen 68% over the last decade and Exxon's sterling credit rating has just been downgraded, increasing the company's cost of capital. Continuing to grow high cost fossil fuel reserves in the face of global climate change disruptive agreement is no longer prudent.\\n\\nCitigroup estimates unburnable fossil fuel reserves could amount to over $1 trillion out to 2050. While the Carbon Tracker Initiative estimates that as oil majors choose to undertake projects consistent with a 2-degree demand level, combined upstream assets would actually be worth $140 billion more.\\n\\nWe are asking our company to prioritize value over growth, investing in the most profitable core carbon assets and returning a greater percentage of profits to shareholders, which would allow Exxon to decrease in size while increasing profitability, essentially shifting from a business plan of growth for growth's sake to one of value.\\n\\nTo the opposite end, profitability has decreased, while total capital distributions have fallen for the last three years, by 35% last year and they're projected to fall 50% in 2016 from 2014 levels. I urge shareholders, management and the board to fully consider this strategically important issue at such a critical juncture. Thank you.\\n\\n\", \"Thank you, Ms. Lamb. The board recommends a vote against this proposal as outlined on Pages 66 and 67 of the proxy statement.\\n\\nThe next shareholder proposal calls for a policy to limit global temperature increases to 2 degrees centigrade and is shown on Pages 67 and 68 of the proxy statement. I understand that Sister Patricia Daly will present the proposal.\\n\\n\", \"Good morning, Mr. Tillerson. How are you today?\\n\\n\", \"I'm well. Thank you.\\n\\n\", \"Good morning, everybody, and members of the board. My name is Sister Patricia Daly. I'm a Dominican Sister of Caldwell, New Jersey, the lead filer along with 32 other institutional investors, most of whom -- many of whom are here today, but most of whom are members of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, representing faith-based initiatives, institutions, Native American tribes, health care systems and asset management firms.\\n\\nI move Item 11 on the proxy, which asks ExxonMobil to adopt a policy acknowledging the imperative to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius. This resolution calls for moral leadership on the part of our company. Accepting the moral obligation of the 2-degree target in the midst of the climate crisis is surely the lowest hurdle our company will face on this issue.\\n\\nInstead, in opposing this resolution, our company has chosen to disregard the consensus of the scientific community, the will of 195 nations that signed the Paris Agreement in December, many of our peers in the oil and gas industry and the calls of faith leaders from the Catholic, Jewish, Christian, Muslim, Buddhist and interfaith traditions. I'm particularly and personally challenged by our Pope Francis in his encyclical letter, Laudato Si', that was published last year, a reflection to all peoples on the planet on our common home. I hope people here may take the time to read that.\\n\\nOpposing this resolution positions our company against a movement for climate justice. As the world moves forward, ExxonMobil stands still. Every day, new reports and incidents demonstrate the importance of the 2-degree target for the sake of our planet for future generations and vulnerable communities, communities hit hardest by climate change. Record wildfires still rage in Alberta, disrupting the production of the very tar sands fueling global warming. We can see impacts today all around us.\\n\\nIn a world already facing the worst refugee crisis in generations, continued conflict and war and projected extreme heat waves that will render parts of the world uninhabitable, we must limit our warming to 2 degrees. Decades have been lost in the fight against climate change due in part to our company's deliberate campaign of disinformation.\\n\\nMr. Tillerson, last year, at the oil and gas -- the annual Oil & Money Conference, you said and I quote, \\\"There's also a humanitarian dimension and a moral imperative to what we do.\\\" Today, we ask our company to acknowledge the full breadth of its moral imperative, moral responsibilities to provide the solutions to energy poverty while limiting global warming to less than 2 degrees. Anything less is a false solution for the world's poorest and most vulnerable. Please join your peers like Shell, BP and Saudi Aramco who stated, and I quote, \\\"Our shared ambition is for a 2-degree future. It's a challenge for the whole of society. We are committed to playing our part.\\\" Now ExxonMobil must play its part, too.\\n\\nMr. Tillerson, you said earlier in the energy outlook that you believe that the energy outlook is in line with the 2-degree limit. If you really believe that, why would you and our Board of Directors recommend a vote against this resolution? Thank you.\\n\\n\", \"Thanks, Sister Pat. The board recommends a vote against this proposal as outlined on Pages 68 and 69 of the proxy statement.\\n\\nThe next shareholder proposal calls for a report on impacts of climate change policies and is shown on Pages 69 and 70 of the proxy statement. I understand that Edward Mason will present the proposal. Mr. Mason?\\n\\n\", \"Thank you. Chairman, members of the board, shareholders, good morning. My name is Edward Mason from the Church Commissioners for England, who manage the Church of England's endowment. We're long-term shareholders interested in the sustainable success of the companies in which we invest, and it's a pleasure to be here in Dallas for Exxon's annual meeting.\\n\\nThe Church Commissioner is a lead co-filer of shareholder Proposal Number 12, which was filed by New York State Common Retirement Fund, whom I'm also representing. The resolution asks Exxon to publish annually an analysis of how its portfolio stress tests against a scenario in which the world restricts warming to 2 degrees. This is a reasonable request.\\n\\nChairman, as you have acknowledged this morning, climate change is real. The desire of global governments to restrict warming to below 2 degrees, affirmed in the Paris Agreement, is real. The financial risks and opportunities for companies associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy are real. These risks have been recognized by the global Financial Stability Board chaired by the governor of the Bank of England, which has created a task force on climate-related financial disclosure.\\n\\nExxon's peers have agreed to provide regular portfolio resilience reporting, including BP, Shell and Total. At BP and Shell's annual meetings last year, the reporting request was endorsed by 98% of shareholders at both companies. Because of Exxon's decision to diverge from its peers and oppose the request in this resolution, management will today experience a major shareholder revolt.\\n\\nChairman, the board is losing the confidence of its investors on climate change. In the run-up to this annual meeting, investors with over $10 trillion of assets affirmed their support for this shareholder proposal.\\n\\nMany of the world's largest asset managers are voting against management today -- Aegon, Amundi, Aviva Investors, AXA Investment Managers, BMO Global Asset Management, BNP Paribas Investment Partners, HSBC Global Asset Management, Legal & General Investment Management, Natixis Asset Management, Robeco and Schroders. The world's largest sovereign wealth fund, the Norwegian Government Pension Fund, pension schemes from around the world from the public and private sector alike and church investors like us from three continents are all voting against management.\\n\\nChairman and members of the board, Exxon can do better. Following today's vote, the investors backing this proposal look forward to starting afresh and having a responsive and productive engagement with the company on climate-related disclosures.\\n\\n\", \"Thank you, Mr. Mason. The board recommends a vote against this proposal as outlined on Pages 70 and 71 of the proxy statement.\\n\\nThe next shareholder proposal calls for the company to report reserve replacement in BTUs and is shown on Page 71 of the proxy statement. I understand that Danielle Fugere will present the proposal. Ms. Fugere?\\n\\n\", \"Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen of the board, Mr. Chairman and all shareholders gathered here today, good morning. My name is Danielle Fugere. Thank you for the opportunity to move Item 13 entitled Carbon Asset Transition. This proposal sends a clear message that shareholders want our company to prepare to thrive in the coming clean energy economy. It's becoming clear, and I think we've heard today, that business as usual is no longer a viable strategy for the 21st century and in fact is incompatible with a livable planet.\\n\\nRecognizing the urgency facing businesses to respond to climate change, this proposal seeks to provide a means by which our company can move beyond the current business model, begin to respond to new opportunities and consider becoming an energy company for the future.\\n\\nThis proposal asks Exxon to account for energy reserves in resource-neutral BTUs, or British thermal units, an internationally accepted energy unit, in addition to the traditional barrels of oil equivalent. Since Exxon already uses BTUs, this reporting is not difficult to accomplish. And this seemingly minor accounting tweak will have major consequences. It will help our economy and the market account for and place value on a range of energy resources beyond just oil and gas, including geothermal, cellulosic biofuels, wind, solar and other energy resources. By aligning one of the market's primary valuation metrics, reserve replacement, with this imperative for lower carbon energy, a path to become a truly diversified and competitive energy can be forged.\\n\\nCurrently, in oil and gas companies, market value is based in large part on reserve replacement ratio. Did the company replace every used barrel of oil it produced with a newly discovered barrel of oil? If annual oil reserve replacement isn't 100% or greater, a company's stock market value may be impaired. Unfortunately, we saw both of these things happen to Exxon this year when S&P downgraded the company's credit, it noted that in its view, the company's greatest business challenge is replacing its ongoing production.\\n\\nThe all-important reserve replacement metric locks management into an endless hunt for more oil and gas. So shareholders look to Exxon to be a leader in beginning the inevitable transition to becoming a diversified energy company, able to compete in a decarbonizing economy. Imagine energy analysts looking at Exxon's filings in the future and seeing 67% of barrels of oil equivalent replacement and 100% BTUs, and then the next year, 60% barrels replaced and again, 100% BTUs. This tells a story of a company in transition to not only survive, but thrive in a clean energy economy. We urge shareholders to vote in support of proxy Item 13. Thank you for your attention.\\n\\n\", \"Thank you, Ms. Fugere. The board recommends a vote against this proposal as outlined on Page 72 of the proxy statement.\\n\\nThe last shareholder proposal calls for a report on hydraulic fracturing and is shown on Pages 72 and 73 of the proxy statement. And I understand, Ms. Fugere, you will present this proposal as well.\\n\\n\", \"Thank you. I'm also presenting Item 14, a shareholder proposal requesting Exxon to increase its transparency on hydraulic fracturing operations. A similar proposal was filed last year and received 25% support from voting share owners.\\n\\nRather than improving its transparency, however, Exxon has remained a laggard in demonstrating to shareholders that it is using practices that reduce risk and reduce harms. In the face of well-known environmental and social impacts, the public has continued to pass restrictions and moratoria, limiting business opportunities and imposing a wide range of costs on companies, from the cost of delay to complete loss of access to valuable resources, all of which materially impact investors' holdings. Improved reporting helps reassure the public that companies are addressing local issues such as air and water pollution, truck traffic and noise and competition for water in water-scarce areas.\\n\\nLocal issues require local reporting, thus we ask the company to report on local issues on a play-by-play basis, so that neighbors can understand specifically what the company is doing in their neighborhood. If Exxon reports worldwide reductions in air pollution, that does nothing to alleviate concerns of local community members about what the company might be doing in their neighborhoods.\\n\\nBetter reporting also provides information as to whether the company is using best practices in places where they are not legally required to do so. Stating that the company follows the law is not useful in places where the law doesn't sufficiently protect communities. Methane leakage is a good example. The public and lawmakers are focused like lasers on the issue of whether companies are monitoring or/and addressing methane leakage where it occurs. If leaks aren't addressed, natural gas may become worse for the climate than coal. While methane leakage laws are being developed, it's critically important that industry and Exxon get out in front of the issue and trumpet the actions they are taking to prevent or address methane leaks.\\n\\nExxon is currently far behind other companies in its reporting. Leaders like BHP Billiton, Hess, Apache, CONSOL and Noble Energy earned top scores this year in a report called Disclosing the Facts, while Exxon rated near the bottom, again, far behind its peers and frankly, behind where such a leading company should be. Peer reporting has earned these other companies accolades, and the sky hasn't fallen around them.\\n\\nIn the absence of meaningful disclosures, shareholders have no way to fully assess the steps Exxon is taking, both over time and relative to peers, regarding its actions to reduce the impact of its shale oil and gas operations. It's beyond time that Exxon begin to demonstrate leadership in this important area. We encourage shareholders to vote for proxy Item number 14 to increase Exxon's transparency and communicate on these important issues. Thank you.\\n\\n\", \"Thank you, Ms. Fugere. The board recommends a vote against this proposal as outlined on Pages 73 and 74 of the proxy statement.\\n\\nAll items of business have now been introduced.

I'd like to emphasize that your comments should be limited to only the board and shareholder proposals in the proxy statement at this time. As I said earlier, we'll try to set some time aside to address other topics if we have time remaining. We received a number of questions on proxy cards and through our website.

So I would welcome your questions or comments at this time.\\n\\nQuestions and Answers\\n\\n\", \"There in the back.\\n\\n\", \"Fellow shareholders -- oh sorry. My name is David Riesman. I'm speaking on Item Nine, lobbying. Fellow shareholders, member of the board, I'm here representing Yale University's Dwight Hall, one of the co-filers of the lobbying proposal.\\n\\nYale and over 1,000 academics have publicly indicated support of this proposal. In the past year, Exxon has come under unprecedented scrutiny of its political spending and public policy positions, including ongoing investigations by the state attorney general to determine whether ExxonMobil deliberately misled the public and investors. This investigation and the risk it poses to shareholder value underscore the need to improve disclosure and oversight of our company's lobbying, especially through third parties.\\n\\nExxon publicly supports a carbon tax and acknowledges the realities of climate change, but its lobbying practices appear to conflict with his positions. Exxon's management justifies its support of organizations that obstruct climate policy by claiming that Exxon supports some, but not all, of the actions of such organizations.\\n\\nHowever, because Exxon is an oil and gas company, the company's exposure to climate policy obstructionism is in danger of being construed as intentional. We believe that ExxonMobil shareholders deserve to understand the process by which the company contributes to organizations whose positions contradict Exxon's stated principles, blocking progress on climate change.\\n\\nIt's hard to take these principles in good faith while seeing these contradictory practices. For example, Exxon is an active leader and funder of ALEC, a primary agent of climate policy obstructionism. The company has justified participation in ALEC on the basis of the organization's STEM lobbying, among others.\\n\\nHowever, Exxon can pursue STEM lobbying through other organizations. Recently, 100 companies have publicly left ALEC. Many companies, including Shell and BP, have determined that ALEC's harmful climate obstruction outweighs any of ALEC's benefits. Given that ALEC's harmful policy obstruction seems to overshadow any other membership benefits, why is this company still associated with ALEC? Thank you.\\n\\n\", \"Thank you. Other speakers? All right, down here. I didn't hear a question.\\n\\n\", \"Why the company is still associated with ALEC, given the previous statements?\\n\\n\", \"Well, ALEC, as you probably know, is an organization of state legislators and legislative bodies, over 400 members. And most of the most productive legislation in this country is passed at state levels.\\n\\nWe have found our engagement with them to be very productive in a number of broad areas, whether it's tax policy, other regulatory areas, particularly educational reform, and that is why we remain engaged with them. We find them to be a highly competent and very thoughtful policy organization. Whether we agree with the positions they ultimately take or not, we find the engagement very useful to our understanding of these issues, and we intend to continue.\\n\\nDown here.\\n\\n\", \"Thank you. Mr. Tillerson, members of the board, my name is Michael MacCracken. I've been a climate change scientist for nearly 50 years, and I'm here on behalf of Mercy Investment Services, speaking with respect to the items raised in Proposals 11 and 12.\\n\\nAt last year's shareholder meeting, Mr. Tillerson, you responded to an audience question that climate model results were too uncertain to be reliable, and that if emissions cutbacks were not sufficient, engineering ways would emerge and serve as plan B. While we'll have no -- or we'll have no choice but to try and adapt, I'd suggest that the international scientific community would take strong exception to the viewpoints you expressed with respect to what it means with regards to national and international policies.\\n\\nOn the first point, in DOE's major, widely peer-reviewed 1985 climate change assessment that preceded IPCC, Exxon's leading climate change scientist for the past several decades, Dr. Brian Flannery, coauthored the chapter on projecting climate change. That chapter concluded that quote, \\\"Climate models currently available when run with standard scenarios of fossil fuel CO2 emissions indicate a global warming of the order of 1 degrees C by the year 2000 relative to the year 1850, an additional 2 to 5 degrees C warming over the next century.\\\" So that projection was made three decades ago, and it's still the case today. Basically, we've had a good sense of what the large-scale outcomes were, but the actions we have taken have really not changed things much.\\n\\nIndeed, as you said last year, improving climate models and having more data and computer resources have been helpful, but there are inevitable uncertainties. The top line conclusions, however, have not changed over this entire period. The main reason now for the differences between models is with respect to the choices we make with what energy technologies we have, what emissions we have. So basically, we need to decide what's going to happen with respect to the future.\\n\\nWith the potential -- with respect to the potential for mitigation -- with adapting, all major assessments indicate that it's going to be very hard technologically and economically to adapt to a lot of the different consequences, biodiversity and other things.\\n\\nSo my question would relate to these resolutions, have to do with what due diligence analyses ExxonMobil has done to date with respect to the likelihood and what we're finding in the scientific community, the consequences are becoming more severe -- likely to be more severe than IPCC has been projecting? And what win-win solutions ExxonMobil is looking for to try and meet the more aggressive actions that are going to be needed to meet the Paris accord and objectives.\\n\\n\", \"Well, as you and I have spoken before, my view on the competency of the models has really not changed. And in fact, that is reflected in the IPCC's own FAQs. In the FAQs following the Paris climate accord, the question was asked of the IPCC panel, is there a scientific basis for the 2-degree centigrade target?\\n\\nAnd you can go to the FAQ and find this for yourself. I'm going to paraphrase it. The answer is no. There is and they say it, they go on to say there is no scientific basis for the 2-degrees centigrade target. The target has been one chosen by society in a general consensus process. I take no exception to that, okay? So we can set the science apart from what we, as society, decide we're going to choose to pursue as a matter of policy.\\n\\nSo now your question is as a matter of policy. And I said to you relative to the understanding of the science, there's no space between us and the IPCC. We see the science the same way. Our differences on policy choices are, I think, one that is grounded in reality. And the reality is, there is no alternative energy source known on the planet or available to us today to replace the pervasiveness of fossil fuels in our global economy and on our very quality of life, and I would go beyond that and say our very survival.\\n\\nSo it is a judgment of balance between future climatic events, which could prove to be catastrophic, but are unknown by the IPCC's own acknowledgment, and more immediate needs of humanity today to address poverty, starvation, broad-based disease control and the quality of life of billions that people who are still living in today, which is unacceptable to many of us. And the only way out of that is to provide them the energy sources we have today. And that's why we continue to believe fossil fuels will have a significant and important role to play for as far as we can see. And no government studies disagree with that.\\n\\nSo then your second question is what do we do? So then what we do is we have now, for more than three decades, focused our research efforts on given that, that is the case, how can we provide people the capability to use these fuels and these energy sources in a less impactful way? And in the early days, we invested in enormous amounts of time and energy on energy efficiency. How can I continue to carry out my activities consuming the same amount of fossil fuels and have a lower impact on the atmosphere and the surrounding environment? And we continue that.\\n\\nWe have advanced our technology investigations, and I addressed them today. We think one of the important breakthroughs that is needed is in carbon capture sequestration. If, in fact, our view is -- turns out to be true and the world's going to have to continue to use fossil fuels whether they like it or not, if we can achieve a breakthrough on carbon capture sequestration, we can continue using fossil fuels, capturing the carbon in an economic way and sequestering it. And that is a huge if, but it's also a huge breakthrough that would change things dramatically. A lot of people are working on that. And we've been working on it on a very long time. And I mentioned today a new endeavor we have entered into that we believe has promise, but we also know it is many years away from perfection.\\n\\nSo those are the kinds of things we are doing. So we are not ignoring the risk that is out there. And I think as you and I discussed, I don't think we see it all that differently. Our differences are how we think we're going to address it. And again, we are grounded in the reality of the world we live in today and what is known technologically to us today. And I would invite you to read a piece that Bill Gates recently wrote where he has undertaken on himself to support research. And he would come to the same conclusion. He and I have had this conversation. There's no space between we -- he and I on this either. We've got to have some technology breakthroughs. But until we achieve those, just saying turn the taps off is not acceptable to humanity. Thank you.\\n\\n\", \"If I may just for a moment respond on the issue of the Paris levels. I mean, it is the case that there's no sort of sharp threshold because consequences are getting worse and worse and worse. And society has set that partly as a political one because it can't achieve what the scientific community would suggest, which is -- it was about 0.5 degree warming when we started losing mass from Greenland and the Antarctic ice sheets. And what paleoclimatic evidence talks about and would say, coming out of the last glacial and as has been the case in the past history, is that sea level rise ultimately is of the order of 15 to 20 meters per degree C warming in global average temperature. It's tremendous, not something that is easily adapted to.\\n\\nSo yes, society chose an arbitrary level, and they haven't committed yet to try and even -- made the commitments to even get to that level. But really, they should be pushing down and doing all they can. And that's what we're basically asking for is doing all that can be done with regard to cutting emissions.\\n\\n\", \"I understand, and so I'm going to respond to a couple of points you made there, and then we're going to move on to another speaker. The factors that you just described, 15 meters, half a degree C, there are a large number of alternative views that suggest those are the most extreme outcomes. And in fact, an IPCC scientific paper, as you well know, they show a very broad range. So you are focusing on the worst possible combination of events from all of the possible scenarios. We choose to look at it as a range of risk, and that's the way we manage our business as well. And again, I don't think there's any space between us other than the solutions that we think we have to pursue.\\n\\nYes, sir, in the middle?\\n\\n\", \"My name is [David Martineau]. I'm a geologist, and I've been drilling and fracking wells for about 56 years now. But the reason I'm here kind of is this interest -- they used to call it global warming, but now it's called climate change. You want to know why? The planet has cooled by 0.07 degrees in this past century, partially because of the Exxon emerging energy policies. We thank you for that.\\n\\nBut if you want to know about global warming, there's a book called Unstoppable Global Warming, and it was a bestseller in The New York Times. And it tells you why we have global warming today, and we've been having it forever and ever.\\n\\nThe other item was an article that was written by, I can't read my numbers here, let me (inaudible - microphone inaccessible) by Ian Pilmer (sic - Ian Plimer). He's an Australian geologist, and he edits the Encyclopedia for Geology. And he came up with where does carbon dioxide really come from? A four-day volcano eruption in Iceland negated every single effort for the past five years to control CO2. Also, there was one in the Philippines in 1991. It spewed out enough greenhouse gas in a year to take care of everything that's happened in our country forever and ever as far as CO2. CO2 is that vital chemical compound that every planet requires to live and grow and synthesize into oxygen for us humans and all animals to live. We need -- global warming is here and it's going to be here forever. Trying to change it here the last few bits doesn't make sense.\\n\\nOne quick thing about fracking. The first frac job occurred, believe it or not, in 1866. Colonel Edward Roberts got out of the military -- Civil War, and he came up with the idea of dropping gunpowder down in a wellbore where they were drilling shallow wells. And they went ahead and ignited that, and it increased the production tenfold. And we've been fracking wells for 100 years. Thanks to that, we have a lot of oil and gas. He patented that, and people didn't want to pay the patent fee. So they would do it at night, and that's where the word moonlighting came from. But if you all don't like what you're doing here, why -- I mean if you don't like Exxon, why don't you go ahead and sell it and buy some solar stock? And whether you'll have enough money to pay for your gasoline and pay for your jet fuel that you used to come to visit here, but I recommend you vote against all of the carbon planet change proposals. Thank you.\\n\\n\", \"Thank you. In the inside aisle here.\\n\\n\", \"Good morning. My name is [Renee Bouchard] and I'm actually from Texas. I live in Wimberley, Texas. Maybe you all are aware, if you watched the news a year ago yesterday, we were inundated by a flood that devastated our town. I lost our home. My family lost our home as well as 400 other homes in Wimberley were destroyed by the catastrophic flood. Needless to say, my feeling is that the effects of climate change are real and are happening now, not something that's abstract and in the future, not something that's just been affecting indigenous populations, even though that's really heartbreaking as well. Our flood was one of five flooding-related federal disasters in Texas just in the past two years.\\n\\nI've lived in this area for over 20 years. Flooding, as you know, you'll be saying: flooding happens in that part of Texas. That's true, but not like this, a 40-foot wall of water, 13 inches of rain. Anyway, when these disasters happen, federal taxpayers spend billions on aid and bailouts. As you all probably are aware, State Attorneys Generals have suggested fossil fuel companies may be legally liable for these climate damages. I think from today's meeting, I know what your position is and whether Exxon should be held legally liable for damages from climate change.\\n\\nSo my question is, what happens if the company loses in the coming court battles? And I anticipate there will be more. How is Exxon calculating the financial risks it would face if fossil fuel companies have to pay for damage from climate change, like the tobacco companies who, for many decades, said cigarettes were not an unhealthy thing to take part in. Thank you.\\n\\n\", \"Speculating on future court events would be irresponsible on my part, and therefore those numbers will be unestimable. Over here.\\n\\n\", \"Good morning. I'm Kathy Mulvey with the Union of Concerned Scientists, and I'm attending on the proxy of the Unitarian Universalist Association. And I have a question related to Item Nine on transparency and in climate science and policy.\\n\\nLast July, UCS published The Climate Deception Dossiers, evidence that ExxonMobil and other major fossil fuel companies have intentionally spread disinformation about climate science for decades. I have one copy here. So as state Attorneys General investigate whether ExxonMobil misled investors and the public about the realities and risks of climate change, people are increasingly making comparisons to the tobacco industry's misconduct and measures taken to address it. ExxonMobil now claims that quote, \\\"We do not fund or support those who deny the reality of climate change.\\\"\\n\\nBut actions speak louder than words. ExxonMobil is represented on the board of the American Petroleum Institute, API, which continues to claim that the science of climate change is unsettled, while attempting to block efforts to limit carbon pollution. Exxon's Randy Randol contributed to a notorious 1998 road map plan to sow uncertainty about climate science among the media, the public and policymakers. Other shareholders have spoken about ALEC, which was one of the organizations that API identified to bankroll that campaign. Your company sponsored ALEC's 2015 annual meeting where attendees were told, \\\"The biggest scam of the last 100 years is global warming.\\\"\\n\\nMr. Tillerson, more than 26,000 UCS supporters have sent messages to you demanding that ExxonMobil stop funding ALEC as your peers, BP and Shell, have done. You've spoken this morning of commitment to integrity in everything we do. When will your company publicly condemn climate deception? And in response to the question from the Yale student, you seemed to imply perhaps not agreeing with ALEC. So what would a commitment to integrity mean in terms of separating the company from ALEC's climate disinformation?\\n\\n\", \"The only way I know to respond is to tell you that we will never withdraw our support for people to express their free-speech opinions on any matter whatsoever. And the fact that people have different opinions on climate change, they have every right to their opinion. Whether we agree with it or not, I will support their right to say so.\\n\\n\", \"To follow up on that, it's quite clear from legal rulings that the First Amendment was never intended to protect fraud. And so clearly, there are consumer protection laws in the several federal states that are designed to present -- prevent commercial misinformation, so.\\n\\n\", \"And we have responded to those allegations as well. They have largely been debunked. All of our publications are readily available, as you know, for examination. In fact, we donated all of those archives to the University of Texas at Austin. If we were wanting to hide something, we did a pretty poor job of it.\\n\\nLet's go to the lady in the back there. No, right here, just in the middle.\\n\\n\", \"I don't intend to speak and then I sit and write notes. My name is [Charlotte Rawls]. I come from Shoreacres, Texas, which is on Galveston Bay. I overlook the Baytown refinery. I watch and see what happens there daily because my window overlooks it. And what I see is a lot of smoke and a lot of flares. And then I cross the Fred Hartman Bridge and I go into Baytown, and I work with school children there. I work with school children who have much asthma -- and also in that area, heart disease and a lot of respiratory problems and cancer.\\n\\nI think it's no wonder that we have one of the premier cancer institutes in Houston, MD Anderson, because we do have so much cancer in our area. When it rains, we see much more and the smells -- and definitely, it smells like toxins to me, I don't know exactly what it is. I would like to see zero emissions. If we're not going to admit to climate change and admit that fossil fuels are causing -- are a part of climate change, so at least let's look at the health effects from the things that are coming out of the plants.\\n\\nI have experience in Baytown, but I also read about experiences about other people around the world. The other thing that happens with children is IQs are lowered when there's significant amounts of air pollution, which there are in the city of Baytown.\\n\\nI do appreciate your admitting that there is climate change. I've been to several meetings. I followed ExxonMobil very closely because I'm a third generation shareholder. My grandfather worked for the Humble Pipe Line in -- right after World War I, and we did not buy anything, but Humble. We didn't go to Shell, we didn't go to Mobil, we didn't go anywhere. We went to Humble. And it was not until the Exxon Valdez disaster that I started going to other places.\\n\\nI continue to have my stock and then inherited my mother's stock. So I would also like to say something on behalf of my mother, which she voted every year, her proxy. And she said we need more women represented on the Board of Directors. I see a couple. I need to see more.\\n\\nThe other thing I debate often, whether I need to divest of my Exxon stock. I'm sorry, I still call it Exxon stock. ExxonMobil stock. It's been a dilemma for me for a long time because I keep thinking that I can influence change. I've done that through the Waterkeeper Alliance. I've done that through the Natural Resources Defense Council. I've done it through Earthjustice.\\n\\nI try, I try, I try to make things better, but it's about time to divest. I do benefit greatly from the stock. However, when I look to see what taxpayers are going to be paying for, I'm not sure it's that good of a deal. Health care, and I want to go back to ALEC because we have still --\\n\\n\", \"Could you begin to wrap it up?\\n\\n\", \"I'm sorry. I think it's more expensive to own my stock than to take my dividends.\\n\\n\", \"Thank you. So over here to this side of the hall.\\n\\n\", \"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ladies and gentlemen, members of the board and fellow shareholders. My name is Robert Fore. I'm here representing the shares of the Presbyterian Church U.S.A.'s Foundation. And as long-term shareholders, we are very concerned -- and well, very concerned about the long-term sustainability and importantly, profitability of our company.\\n\\nAnd I'm going to talk a little bit about the Items 11 and 12 today and talk specifically about some of the peer groups that were mentioned, peer companies and their recognition of the 2-degree scenario. Specifically, I want to talk about one, which is Saudi Aramco. Saudi Arabia has made it clear that they are seeking to monetize their oil reserves now, regardless of the impact on price.\\n\\nMinister Al-Naimi said that he could live with $20 per barrel. The Deputy Crown Prince has said $30 per barrel or $70 per barrel, it's all the same to them. And he has furthermore announced plans, a plan called Vision 2030, in which he wants to wean his country off of oil by the year 2030 or sooner.\\n\\nGiven the global signals of the end of the oil era, from low commodity prices to recent statements and decisions from Saudi Aramco to start selling shares publicly to build up a $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund, we're concerned about some of the claims of the future of energy will look very much like the past.\\n\\nI think you've talked a little bit today about 2040 scenarios. My question is, what do the Saudis -- or why do the Saudis see the future of oil -- future of energy so differently than the leadership of ExxonMobil? What do they know that we are not considering? Furthermore, what specifically are you doing to ensure the business model of ExxonMobil is nimble enough to withstand low carbon demand scenarios, including disruptions, be they technological regulatory or market-based?\\n\\n\", \"Well, as to Saudi Aramco's views or the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, I -- you would have to ask them. I can't speak on their behalf. I think we showed you today a number of things that we're doing in terms of remaining flexible to alternative outcomes in the future.\\n\\nWe have, unlike many of our competitors, we have for many years included a price of carbon in our outlook. And that price of carbon gets put into all of our economic models when we make investment decisions as well.\\n\\nIt's a proxy. We don't know how else to model what future policy impacts might be. But whatever policies are, ultimately they come back to either your revenues or your cost. So we choose to put it in as a cost.\\n\\nSo we have accommodated that uncertainty in the future, and everything gets tested against it. As to other actions, it's the research areas you see in terms of our understanding of the issue. And we probably have been engaged in the scientific study of this longer than any of our peers for four decades now. And we continue to be engaged, so we are very, very aware and up-to-date on the current scientific understanding. And we fund a number of research areas, both academically and institutionally, that are areas where people are investigating possible breakthroughs, whether it'd be in battery technologies or alternative fuel technologies or what's the next possible game-changing technology.\\n\\nWe do that so we're aware of whether that is something that has potential or not. And so we monitor all of that, and we invest and run our programs accordingly. And should something evolve, we have the capacity to become engaged in that if we see it is in the interest of our shareholders. So that's how we're responding.\\n\\nSo back over here.\\n\\n\", \"Mr. Tillerson, my name is [Hunter Martin]. My wife and I have been driving up here from Houston for more than 25 years, going back to Larry Rawl's days for the meetings. And I think I bought my first shares of the company probably the year you were born. And I don't presume --\\n\\n\", \"I wish my dad had bought some shares the year I was born.\\n\\n\", \"I do not presume to forecast what's going to happen over the next 12 months. But [Lori] and I want to thank you and compliment you on your stewardship of our company.\\n\\nApplying whatever parameters one would choose, you personify all that is best in America and world industry, and the lives of all of us shareholders are more secure and in return, happier because of you.\\n\\nOur thanks embrace the employees as well as the board. At the top, of course, is you and your superlative guidance. Congratulations on your achievements, Mr. Tillerson, and thanks for your dedication to all of us.\\n\\n\", \"Thank you for those kind words. Right here.\\n\\n\", \"CEO Tillerson, it's good to have the opportunity to speak to you. So my name is [Anna Kolinski] and my grandfather, James F. Black, was a scientist for Exxon for over 40 years. He started with Standard Oil during World War II, later earned dozens of patents for Esso and later Exxon.\\n\\nIn 1977, he briefed the company's top executives on the scientific realities of climate change. He said that present thinking holds that man has a time window of 5 to 10 years before the need for hard decisions regarding changes in energy strategies might become critical. Like you acknowledge on your slides, this was over 30, almost 40 years ago. And since then, Exxon has continued to support groups that dispute the science that my grandfather warned your company about.\\n\\nMy question was going to be, will you withdraw funding from ALEC because they're known to spread misinformation about climate change, but it sounds like your answer on that is a resounding no. So since you won't be doing that, will Exxon be taking action to, at all, refute or counteract the negative impacts they're making by funding an organization that says that climate change is a scam?\\n\\n\", \"We will continue to engage in the policy discussions, as we currently do, with a number of broad-based groups on all sides of these issues and we'll continue to be active in the discussions legislatively in Washington and elsewhere, including through the IPCC on what we think are thoughtful, sensible policy actions that accommodate both our need for economic growth as well as addressing these risks, which are going to be very, very daunting. Thank you.\\n\\n<Presentation>\\n\\n\", \"I believe all the items of business have been covered now. So if any of you have proxy cards, please hand them to the ushers at this time. Those of you who have already returned your proxy cards need not vote by ballot unless you wish to change your votes. If you wish to change your vote, simply mark the appropriate sections of the ballot. The ballots will now be collected and turned over to the inspectors of election to be counted. If you wish your ballot to be kept secret, the ushers will provide you an envelope.\\n\\nThe appointed proxies in attendance today hereby cast all votes which we have been authorized to cast, in accordance with the instructions indicated on the individual proxy cards. So if you have proxies, please pass those to the ushers in the aisles at this time.\\n\\nSince proxies and ballots have been collected, I now declare the polls closed.\\n\\nQuestions and Answers\\n\\n\", \"While the inspectors of election are preparing their preliminary report, I'm willing to answer a few more questions regarding ExxonMobil's business, maybe one or two because time is running late on us. But I'll interrupt at the point that the election results are available. So are there any other questions that people would like to put to me at this time? Let me go over here to someone that's not spoken.\\n\\n\", \"Good morning, Mr. Tillerson, directors and fellow stockholders and employees and retirees of the corporation. For many years -- I'm a retiree of the corporation now. But for many years, I was on boards of health care and safety for the company. For years, we were told that in health care area, we have to have a big pool for synergies and for economies of scale. But today, I understand that the pool has been split between employees' health care and retiree annuitant' health care.\\n\\nMy question to you, Mr. Tillerson, is one is why was this done because we no longer reach these economies of scale if we split the health care pool? And two is any forward comments you can make about what the future might hold for us annuitants as far as the Medicare supplement plan or any health care that the company still helps us afford? Thank you.\\n\\n\", \"Well, I'm not sure I would characterize it as a splitting of the pools. We have -- obviously, we track claims and premiums in both of those pools. And so the changes you've seen are merely reflective of that experience.\\n\\nFor many, many years, the retiree pool has been subsidized by the employee pool, and it still is today. And it's just a question of how much of that burden -- as we continue to bring our manning levels down within the corporation, from roughly 115,000 at the time of the ExxonMobil merger to 73,000 today. We've got a look at the cost of the plan to everyone.\\n\\nI do want to acknowledge that all of our plan participants, retirees included, have really done a very, very good job managing their health issues, which has allowed us to keep our growth in health care costs down. And so we appreciate that.\\n\\nBut the changes you're seeing are really just reflective of having to bring the things back into balance. I encourage everyone to continue to take advantage of the various programs that we do provide through the company to help manage your health care. That helps us keep the cost of the program down. As you know, it's a self-funded program.\\n\\nHave you got a comment down here or a question?\\n\\n\", \"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My name's Julian Martinez, and I represent SER Jobs for Progress National. SER is a national, nonprofit, community-based organization serving more than 1.3 million people a year by assisting them with their employment and educational needs.\\n\\nSER National would like to thank ExxonMobil for working with us and Hispanic Heritage foundation in the past. Your efforts in sponsoring STEM programs is exemplary, and we appreciate those efforts. However, an area that we strongly believe needs improvement is your governance.\\n\\nExxonMobil has no Hispanics on their board nor on their senior management team. In order to reflect the diverse nature of the American marketplace, you need to consider making some changes.\\n\\nThe American dream is alive and well. Hispanics born in this country are more highly educated and earn higher incomes than their immigrant parents. Hispanics outpace all other Americas in forming their own businesses. They will represent fully one-third of the U.S. population in just 45 years and be an economic force of great consequence. Latino-owned businesses increased 46.9% from 2007 to 2012.\\n\\nIn 2012, 3.3 million Latino businesses had receipts totaling over $517 billion, making it 12% of our total business. Female Latino business owners were 44.4% of Latino firms as compared to 35.3% for non-Latino firms. Hispanics are the youngest racial or ethnic group in the United States. About one-third or 17.9 million of the Latino population is younger than 18, about a quarter or 14.6 million are millennials. Exxon needs to consider who both their workforce and the customers will be and embody governance and leadership to reflect that market.\\n\\nMy question, totally unrelated is, what do you think the price of oil is going to do between one and five years?\\n\\n\", \"Well, as many of have heard me say before, if I knew that, I wouldn't be here. I'd be on the beach with my laptop, making an oil bet every morning. So I don't know is the answer to the question.\\n\\n<Presentation>\\n\\n\", \"The inspectors of election are ready to report the preliminary vote. So may we have your report, please?\\n\\n\", \"Mr. Chairman, at least 3.5 billion shares of stock of the corporation have been voted on the 14 items of business discussed at today's meeting. Voting results are expressed as a percentage of total votes cast. According to New Jersey corporate law, abstentions are not votes cast.\\n\\nSubject to the final tabulation of votes, which should not materially change the results, we report that on average, 95.9% of the votes cast were voted to elect as directors the 14 nominees listed in the proxy statement.\\n\\nOn the resolution concerning the ratification of independent auditors, approximately 98.9% of the shares voting thereon were voted for, and 1.1% were voted against.\\n\\nOn the resolution concerning an advisory vote to approve executive compensation, approximately 89.3% of the shares voting thereon were voted for and 10.7% were voted against.\\n\\nOn the resolution concerning an independent chairman, approximately 38.8% of the shares voting thereon were voted for, and 61.2% were voted against.\\n\\nOn the resolution concerning a climate expert onboard, approximately 20.9% of the shares voting thereon were voted for, and 79.1% were voted against.\\n\\nOn the resolution concerning hire an investment bank, approximately 2% of the shares voting thereon were voted for, and 98% were voted against.\\n\\nOn the resolution concerning a proxy access bylaw, approximately 61.9% of the shares voting thereon were voted for, and 38.1% were voted against.\\n\\nOn the resolution concerning a report on compensation for women, approximately 8.5% of the shares voting thereon were voted for, and 91.5% were voted against.\\n\\nOn the resolution concerning a report on lobbying, approximately 25.8% of the shares voting thereon were voted for, and 74.2% were voted against.\\n\\nOn the resolution concerning increased capital distributions, approximately 4.1% of the shares voting thereon were voted for, and 95.9% were voted against.\\n\\nOn the resolution concerning a policy to limit global warming to 2 degrees C, approximately 18.5% of the shares voting thereon were voted for and 81.5% were voted against.\\n\\nOn the resolution concerning a report on impacts of climate change policies, approximately 38.2% of the shares voting thereon were voted for, and 61.8% were voted against.\\n\\nOn the resolution concerning report reserves replacements in BTUs, approximately 5.5% of the shares voting thereon were voted for, and 94.5% were voted against.\\n\\nOn the resolution concerning a report on hydraulic fracturing, approximately 24.5% of the shares voting thereon were voted for, and 75.5% were voted against.\\n\\nOur written reports will be submitted to the secretary as soon as they are completed.\\n\\n\", \"Thank you. As stated in the written report of inspectors of election on each of these -- a written report of the inspectors of election on each of these matters will be delivered to the secretary, and they will be filed with the SEC on a Form 8-K.\\n\\nIn concluding the meeting, let me thank all of you once again for attending. We appreciate you taking the time and the effort to be here. We know some of you travel a long way to be with us today, and we always enjoy seeing you, and we appreciate that you take that time. We take all of your comments seriously. It is useful to us to hear from you. And even where we disagree, I know our disagreements are both sincere on the issues as we all see them.

It also deems this to be a pretty subjective tweet, with a subjectivity score of 0.8. It does indeed appear to be expressing a subjective opinion. Finally, we can see which words are leading to this assessment. The word \"good\" is leading to a 0.7 increase in the polarity score, and a 0.6 increase in the subjectivity score. The word \"worst\" is leading to a -1 change polarity, and a +1 change in subjectivity. The overall scores are weighted averages of these values. Though these scores do roughly align with the actual sentiment of this tweet, **ALWAYS** pay attention to whats going on inside of your sentiment analysis pipeline. Even though the overall sentiment score here is negative, it should probably be even more negative; the algorithm picked up on the word \"good\" in this tweet, and this improved the polarity score by 0.7. But the context in which \"good\" was uttered in this tweet is actually negative! the person is saying \"stop saying #Tillerson is good on climate\"-- this is expressing negative sentiment!"
